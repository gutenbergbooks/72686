<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After many years of collecting the antiquarian and traditional lore of the Polynesian
Race in general, with the object of identifying the origin and migrations of the Hawaiians
in particular, which formed the basis of his scholarly work on that subject, Abraham
Fornander, with a corps of native helpers of known ability (notably S.&nbsp;M. Kamakau,
the historian; J. Kepilino, and S.&nbsp;N. Haleole), gathered from among the people throughout
the group a most valuable collection of material covering Hawaiian mythology, traditions,
meles and genealogies. Following his death in 1887, after a residence in the land
of his adoption of forty-five years, this collection of manuscripts was purchased
from his estate for preservation by the late Charles R. Bishop, and later was turned
over by him to the Trustees of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum.
</p>
<p>Upon examination and translation of the various papers comprising the collection,
the Trustees decided to share this treasure with the reading public by issuing it,
in several series, among the Memoirs of the Museum. Most of the translation was completed
under the late Dr. W.&nbsp;D. Alexander’s supervision. Following his death it devolves
upon another to carry out the desires of the Trustees in its revision and editing
for publication. In doing so several amendments and extensions are embodied, but only
such changes as the collector himself would doubtless have made had its preparation
for the press passed through his experienced and painstaking hands, with the view
of preserving it as “The Fornander Collection” of antiquities, traditions, legends,
genealogies and meles of Hawaii. The order in which they were designed by him is observed,
except in the enlargement of this first series to embrace the historic traditional
papers in relatively chronological order. The rest of the series comprises the legendary,
antiquarian and miscellaneous papers and meles.
</p>
<p>This collection of Hawaiian folk-lore was gathered, as stated, some forty or more
years ago. Several of the papers have been published in the native press, and a few,
from translations which have appeared, will be found familiar to English readers,
but by far the largest part comes to the reading public, Hawaiians and foreigners,
for the first time; issued as Hawaiian literature, simply, irrespective of variance
in writers, or inaccuracy in historic narrations. Although some of these papers are
lengthy, yet if any demerit is to be ascribed to the collection, it likely would be
due to incompleteness, or brevity, rather than to undue extension—a fault that has
of late years come into vogue in Hawaiian story-writing. Nor could these tales be
secured from original sources today. The bards, or haku mele, and chanters have passed
away, and even those capable of interpreting the mele and antiquarian subjects are
few. Therefore, the preservation by publication of this collection in the vernacular,
with translations thereof, will increase not only its literary interest, but will
add to its scientific value, while the notes accompanying the English version will
aid the reader in the interpretation of ancient Hawaiian thought and customs.

<p class="first">There are twelve islands in this group and they are situated in the Pacific Ocean
to the north of the Equator and between latitude 18° 54′ and 22° 17′, in west longitude
154° 54′. The wise people are not all agreed as to the origin of these islands, and
some have thought that they appeared or grew up from the sea. But according to the
history of Hawaii, the ideas of the learned historians were entirely different from
that theory. According to the traditions of Wakea<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1594src" href="#xd32e1594">1</a> and his wife Papa, these islands were the real children of this pair, being born
of Papa and having Wakea for their father. Hawaii was the first child of Papa and
Wakea, and some time afterwards Maui was born, and in this manner there were successive
births of eleven islands. But Kahoolawe was not born of Papa and Wakea, but according
to the tradition or legend of Haumea, Hina<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1597src" href="#xd32e1597">2</a> was the one who gave birth to this island and it was called Kahoolawe.

<p class="first">In the tradition of Kauai, it is said Oahu and Kauai had one mother and had different
fathers. Because Ahukinialaa lived with Laamealaakona and Oahu was born a wohi, then
Laakapu lived with Laamealaakona and Kauai was born and this is how the legend runs:
When Laamealaakona first had the child-sickness when conceiving Kauai, she was in
the sacred house in the enclosure of the heiau (temple) of Nonea, and on a day of
the month of Makalii, the day in which the lightnings flashed around this heiau, that
was the day Kauai was born, and this is the king who united with the royal line of
Hawaii. And this is how the legend runs in the part concerning Kauai in the mele commencing
with verse 8:

<p class="first">These lines seem to explain how these islands were sprung from Wakea and Papa, according
to the knowledge or belief held by Pakui, the composer of these songs. He was a priest
and a historian belonging to the board of historians and genealogist of the order
of the priesthood. But in looking at Chapter I of this story the ideas of the historian
are very similar in regard to the birth or appearance of these islands. Also in the
song composed by Pakui in his capacity as a prophet and historian, as seen in this
chapter, but it will be well to note the setting of the genealogy from the time of
Wakea, as shown in the following chapter.

<p class="first">It is told in the genealogy of Opuukahonua that they were the royal parents or ancestors
of these islands, and that there were ninety-five generations from him to Kamehameha
the Great. And they were found or obtained by the fishing of Kapuheeuanui, and thus
runs the tale: When Kapuheeuanui let down his fishing line into the sea from Kapaahu
his line caught something that he thought was a fish and drew the line onto the canoe
when, behold, it was a piece of coral. The priest Laulialamakua came along as Kapuheeuanui
was disentangling his line from the coral and preparing to throw it away. Then the
priest spoke to him, “Eh! Don’t throw away that piece of coral, for that is a chief,
a foreteller of events. Go thou and look for a pig and appease the god, and after
prayer call <span class="corr" id="xd32e2450" title="Source: it’s">its</span> name Hawaiiloa, then throw it back into the sea, and it will grow up into an island.”
Kapuheeuanui obeyed the instructions of the priest. The next day Kapuheeuanui went
fishing again and his line was again caught by a coral. This time he bethought himself
of what the priest had said and took the coral to him, and the priest said to him,
“That is a man, a chief; call his name Mauiloa.” He did so and then threw the coral
back into the sea. On the third day of Kapuheeuanui’s fishing <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>his line was again entangled on a coral, making the third piece of coral brought to
the surface by his line, and, as he had done before after freeing it from his line,
took it to the priest. The latter on beholding this coral exclaimed, “That is a man,
a wohi, a chief from the sacred air; call his name Oahunuialaa.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2455src" href="#xd32e2455">48</a> Kapuheeuanui continued fishing and always took to the priest the corals he caught
on his line, who named them and ordered him to go through the same process of deifying
them, or rather offering sacrifices to them, until all the islands now comprising
the group were successively raised as corals. And thus, according to this tale, the
islands of this group grew up from pieces of coral. But then, this is only a tale,
and this is how one can ascertain the truth that these islands of Hawaii nei really
did grow from corals.

<p>From the first-born child to the one just ahead of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku never took them
up in his arms, never spoke of leaving the kingdom to any of them, nor did he make
much of any of them. But at the birth of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku took the greatest interest
in him, took care of him, took him up in his arms, and to him he willed all his honor
and glory and the kingdom. Because of this show of favoritism on their father’s part
toward Aukelenuiaiku, his brothers and sister hated him and they tried to devise some
way of getting rid of him. Said the oldest of the children, Kamakahinuiaiku:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4966src" href="#xd32e4966">4</a> “Yes, our father is indeed strange; although I am the first-born, still our father
did not promise to leave me his honor and glory, and not even the kingdom, but here
with the last son he has promised to leave these things to him.”

<p>The main pastime indulged in by the brothers of Aukelenuiaiku was wrestling, boxing
and other manly games that were known at that time. In these games they became famous
in all the land of Kuaihelani as being the strongest, and furthermore, these boys
went around the whole country without being beaten. On one of the trips around Kuaihelani
the fame and the strength of Kealohikikaupea, a strong man of Kauai, reached these
boys. The main deed of strength participated in by this man which made him famous
was the great ease he had in breaking a man in two.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4974src" href="#xd32e4974">5</a> When the boys from Kuaihelani arrived in Kauai, one of them met this strong man and
with one blow laid him low. They then made a complete circuit of Kauai without meeting

Oahu. Their names were, Kaikipaananea, <span class="corr" id="xd32e4982" title="Source: Kupukupukekaikalani">Kupukupukehaikalani</span> and Kupukupukehaiiaku. There were none stronger than these three men. Upon the arrival
of the champions of Kuaihelani on Oahu they met in contest, and with one blow the
said men of Oahu were defeated, after which the Kuaihelani champions left Oahu and
went to Maui. Kakaalaneo was the king of Maui at this time, and in a contest he was
vanquished by them.

<p>While the Kuaihelani champions were making a circuit of Maui the fame of Kepakailiula
for his great strength and daring came to them. It was said that he could break [in
pieces] any man who opposed him, and he was the greatest warrior of the whole island
of Hawaii. When the Kuaihelani champions heard of the feats of strength performed
by Kepakailiula, they became afraid and returned to Kuaihelani. Upon their arrival
at their home in Kuaihelani they gave exhibitions of all the sporting games known
to them, such as wrestling, boxing, to wrestle on all fours, to hide a pebble under
piles of kapas, to dance, to roll the stone disk, to jump from high cliffs into the
water, to make the spear glide, and various other games. In getting up these games
they were instigated by the desire of drawing their youngest brother to them, when
they would kill him, for Aukelenuiaiku was kept under Iku’s fostering care all the
time, and was accorded all the honors due to a king, and was jealously guarded.

<p>While Aukelenuiaiku was thus guarded, he one day heard the yells and shouts of the
people who were gathered at the games being held by his brothers, so Aukelenuiaiku
asked of Iku his father: “What is the cause of the shouting down below?” The father
replied: “They are holding some wrestling matches.” “How is that game played?” “It
is played by two persons. They stand up facing each other and each one tries to throw
the other one down to the ground. When one is thrown the people would shout, expressing
their joy. That is the cause of the shouting that you hear.” Aukelenuiaiku then said:
“How I wish to see it!” He therefore questioned his father relating to the various
games. After hearing how they were played, he asked that he be allowed to go down
and look on, but his father refused, saying: “You cannot go down.” Aukelenuiaiku then
asked him: “Why not?” The father replied: “You will be killed by your brothers, for
they hate you.” Aukelenuiaiku then further asked his father: “What is the cause of
the hatred?” The father replied: “There is a reason. It is because I have given you
all the honors and the kingdom. Therefore you must not go down, for if you do you
will be killed by your brothers.”

<p>After ten days had gone by the shouting and yelling at the games were again heard,
but Aukelenuiaiku did not let his father know of the renewal of the games. He then
got up and secretly went down to look at the games, without the knowledge of his father.
In going Aukelenuiaiku took an arrow with him. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived near the
house where his brothers were holding the games, he shot the arrow into the building.
On the arrow entering the building, the brothers took it up and said: <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>“How strange! our arrows are in joints, but this one is twisted!” While they were
discussing the matter one of them took it and after looking it over said: “This is
not a stranger’s arrow; this is the arrow belonging to our brother Aukelenuiaiku.”
While this brother was saying this, Kekamakahinuiaiku, he of the bad temper, took
it and broke it into pieces. Shortly after this Aukelenuiaiku approached the building
and stood on the outside of the wall which surrounded the building. While Aukelenuiaiku
was standing there, all the brothers looked at him. They marveled at his handsome
appearance: his skin was like the ripe banana and his eyeballs were like the bud of
a banana at its first appearance; his body was straight and faultless, and he was
without equal.

sent Kuaiku, saying: “Go and strike him once.” When Kuaiku came up to Aukelenuiaiku,
he struck at him, but he did not knock him down nor did he hurt him. On the first
blow he broke his own right arm, then he tried his left and that too was broken. When
Kuaiku saw that his two arms were broken he turned to proceed back to the house. At
this Aukelenuiaiku reached out and took hold of his brother by the arms, bundled him
up, and threw him to the edge<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e4995src" href="#xd32e4995">6</a> of the sea. When the people saw the great strength of Aukelenuiaiku, they gave a
mighty shout, and said: “That is the only man that has been able to throw and break
the arms of Kuaiku.” After this another of the brothers came out with the intention
of killing Aukelenuiaiku. This brother was the greatest wrestler and could break a
man in arms; but when he met Aukelenuiaiku, he was unable to throw him down or hurt
him. When he found that he was unable to throw Aukelenuiaiku, he turned with the intention
of going back to the house, but Aukelenuiaiku reached out, held him up and threw him
into the sea. This made the people shout again.

<p>Aukelenuiaiku thus met each brother, beating them all until there remained but the
oldest brother, the one with the bad temper. When this brother saw that all his younger
brothers had been defeated by Aukelenuiaiku he went up full of anger, bent on throwing
Aukelenuiaiku into the sea, but in this he proved a failure, for his youngest brother
overmatched him. While they were fighting and pushing each other, Aukelenuiaiku held
his ground so well that the oldest brother became exhausted, and in time gave up all
idea of fighting, and he left Aukelenuiaiku and turned with the intention of going
back to the house. At this Aukelenuiaiku reached out, took hold of him, and threw
him bodily into the sea. When he dropped <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>into the sea his desire of killing Aukelenuiaiku vanished and he began to show signs
of regret and pretended to be friendly. When he came up to Aukelenuiaiku he said:
“Let us cease the conflict and all hatred and let us be friends, since this is only
a fight between brothers.” He then invited Aukelenuiaiku to go to the house, which
invitation was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku, believing it to be sincere. When they entered
the house the oldest brother uncovered the deep pit of Kamooinanea, and took hold
of Aukelenuiaiku and threw him down into it, where the brothers thought Aukelenuiaiku
would die.

death intended for him by his cruel and merciless brothers. As Aukelenuiaiku was falling
down the pit, the angry brother called out: “Say, Kamooinanea, here is your food;
eat him up.” While he was calling, one of his younger brothers, a kind one, came up
running and called down the pit, saying: “Say, Kamooinanea, don’t eat him up, for
he is your own grandson, Aukelenuiaiku, that is being thrown down.” After Aukelenuiaiku
had fallen into the pit his older brothers were much pleased, believing that they
had now gotten rid of him; that he was really dead; and their father’s promise on
him would be unfulfilled, and become utterly void.

he was so handsome and pleasant to look upon, having a perfect physique, and being
without blemish. While the two were talking together, Aukelenuiaiku heard them and
so he asked them: “What are you two talking about?” They answered: “We are expressing
our regrets because we pity you.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he asked them: “And
why?” The men replied: “Because of the death by the great lizard, Kamooinanea.” Aukelenuiaiku

relating to Aukelenuiaiku’s preservation by the lizard. While Aukelenuiaiku was weeping
with his parents, his brothers, who were out surf riding, heard the wailing and so
asked: “For whom is this wailing going on?” “It is Aukelenuiaiku.” When the brothers
heard that the wailing was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku they were so ashamed
that they concluded they would build them a ship and go to some foreign land. They
then rode in on the surf and proceeded direct to the forest. After they had been in
the forest for over two months, Aukelenuiaiku one day went up into the forest to catch
him some birds. After he had caught and cleaned several birds he started a fire and
then put them on the coals to roast. After the birds were cooked he sat down to his
meal, and, while he was eating, his brothers came upon him and took away all the birds,
leaving him nothing. After this the oldest brother, he with the violent temper, ordered
Aukelenuiaiku to go and bring them some water. While Aukelenuiaiku was on his way
for water he got up and followed him. While Aukelenuiaiku was busy filling the calabash
with water the angry brother arrived and replaced the rock on the mouth of the water
hole, shutting in Aukelenuiaiku and left him there to die.

<p>After Aukelenuiaiku’s disappearance the brother returned to where the others were.
When the brother who entertained some love for Aukelenuiaiku saw their oldest brother
coming back, he asked: “Where is our brother?” The oldest brother replied: “I have
not seen him, and he was not at the place where I went to.” After this the brother
who wished to save Aukelenuiaiku got up and went out in search of him. In this search
he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then
took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5078src" href="#xd32e5078">11</a> and wept. While he was weeping their father Iku heard it, and so he inquired: “Who

he is dead.” When their father heard this he also wept.

<p>After this weeping Ikumailani again proceeded up the forest in search of his brother.
Before starting upon his mission their father said to him: “In case you should find
your brother, bring him home here.” Before Ikumailani set out he said to their father:
“I am going up; if you look and see a fire, remember I have found your son; but in
case you don’t see a fire, then I have not found him.” After saying this, Ikumailani
started out on his search. When he came up to the water hole he looked and saw that
the mouth had been covered with a large rock. He then rolled away the rock and looked
down into the hole, and saw Aukelenuiaiku standing there, thin and weak, having only
enough strength left to be able to stand. Ikumailani then reached down for his brother
and lifted him up; they then kissed each other and wept. After their weeping, Ikumailani
started a fire, which was seen by their father, and he knew that Aukelenuiaiku had
been found and that he was not dead.

go with us, because we have no other reason of going away except on your own account.
If you had died we would not be leaving Kuaihelani.” By this refusal on the part of
his brother, Aukelenuiaiku said in kindly reply: “Say, don’t you know that it is a
sad thing to go off to some strange land and die there. Your bones will be put away
by a stranger, perhaps even by a friend, but not by a younger brother, one who has
been born with you and who was from the same womb. I therefore beg of you that I too
be allowed to sail with you, so that in case you my older brothers should die, then
I will die with you. Then our names will come back in fame in the saying, ‘So-and-so
have died with their younger brother.’ Then your names will not be spoken in disrespect.”

<p>By these remarks we see how determined Aukelenuiaiku was in trying to follow his brothers,

still wished and insisted on going with them. If this is so, then we cannot blame
the older brothers if they should kill him. In this request, that he be allowed to
accompany them, however, we will see how he for a time managed to save his brothers
from death, and how he came to have all the benefits foretold him by his lizard grandmother;
and how all the advice she gave Aukelenuiaiku was faithfully kept to his salvation.

proper companion that will be suited to you, because you are young and so am I.’ ”
After these instructions had been imparted by his older brother, their father who
was listening said: “My boy, don’t go with them, for you will be killed. When you
are not safe living with me, what chance will you have when you accompany them? If
you insist on going you will surely get killed, and your mother and I will not see

him what he wanted, he was invited by the nephew to come aboard in the following words:
“My uncle, come aboard of the vessel.” Upon receiving this invitation, Aukelenuiaiku
climbed aboard, while his older brothers looked on, for they dared not deny their
nephew his wish. The boy was their great favorite; whatever he said was law with them,
and all the uncles obeyed his every word. This boy was raised under a very strict
kapu; and if he ordered that a person be killed, that person is killed; if he ordered
that a person be allowed to go free, that person goes off free. Therefore this boy’s
person was sacred, and whatever he said was law; nothing was denied him, and no one
dared say nay to him. They all obeyed him.

<p>After Aukelenuiaiku had climbed aboard, he asked the boy to send someone for his club
and box. When the boy heard this, he sent a couple of men after these things. After
the men had returned with these things, the ship started off on its voyage from Kuaihelani.
In the first four months of the voyage their food, meat and water, were exhausted
and the men began to die of hunger and thirst, and the brothers were in great distress.
When the brothers found that all their food was exhausted, they went down into the
body of the ship and <span class="corr" id="xd32e5107" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> there, while Aukelenuiaiku and the boy <span class="corr" id="xd32e5110" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> above. After several days had gone by, the boy began to wonder at the disappearance
of his father and uncles, so he went down into the ship to look for them. When he
got to the bottom of the vessel he found his father and uncles lying weak from hunger.
The boy then climbed onto the breast of his father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, the one with
the violent temper, and who hated Aukelenuiaiku most of all. As the boy sat on his
father’s chest, the father looked up and when he saw his son he said: “Yes, how pitiful!
I have no regrets as far as we are concerned, for we have spent many days in this
world; but it is you that I pity, for all the food, the meat and water are gone, and
all that is left is two joints of sugar-cane.” The boy replied: “I am not distressed,
for I am not in need of food, for my uncle has a certain leaf which we touch to our
lips and our hunger is satisfied, and we stay without wanting any food for four months.”
After talking with his father for a while, he returned to his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>with tears in his eyes. When the uncle saw that the boy was crying, he asked him:
“What are you weeping for? Why these tears that you are shedding?” The boy replied:
“I am weeping for my father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, who is almost dead of hunger. When
I reached him he was gasping for breath.”
</p>
<p>Aukelenuiaiku then said to the boy: “My boy, you too would have died with your father
and uncles in this ocean if I had not come along with you. I am hated by your father
as his most bitter enemy, but according to our birth by our parents, I will not act
as they have toward me. Therefore, my boy, here is the food, the meat, and the water
in this club of ours (the name of this club was Kaiwakaapu); take it and open one
end of the club, and the food, the meat, the kapa and everything else will come out
of their own accord.” The boy then followed the direction of his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku,
and all the things necessary for their comfort were furnished them. The father and
uncles and those of the ship ate and were saved. Their faintness from hunger disappeared
as well as their weakness.

our peace while you take charge of everything.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “It would be
quite right if it were to be a hand to hand fight, where you could meet your enemy

is to be otherwise, you will not win. This is the reason why I said that we will all

<p>After the thing was settled the four birds started ahead for the house, while Aukelenuiaiku
followed on behind. When the birds arrived, Namakaokahai asked: “Where is the person
that you went in search of?” The brothers replied: “He is coming later. We have offered
you to him as his wife so that we will have him for a brother-in-law; for he is a
handsome looking man, and is perfect from top to bottom; and he is just like you.
We therefore made up our mind that it would be proper that you take him as your husband.”
When the sister heard this she was perfectly satisfied, and she expressed her pleasure
in accepting the man.
</p>
<p>We will now go back to Aukelenuiaiku and his god Lonoikoualii. When the four brothers
of Namakaokahai returned to their sister, after their offer was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku,
his god Lonoikoualii said to him: “These evils and death we have so far been able
to overcome; the evils and death that are yet to come which are worse than these are
the ones we must be careful about. When we get to the queen, your intended wife’s
home, don’t enter the house at once, for it will mean your death; but you must stand
outside by the door and you will see for yourself what they intend to do to you. The
first person whom you will encounter will be the two women who met us first. If they
take compassion on you, then you will be safe. After that the dog will be released,
and if you will overcome him, the brothers will be sent out. After these things, they
will try to get rid of you by poisoning the food. So you must remember. If they offer
you food in the calabash, don’t eat of it, for therein is your death. What you can
eat are the melons that are still on the vines, and you must expect this to be your
food, meat and water.” The god of Aukelenuiaiku, Lonoikoualii, explained all these
things to him in detail and warned him.
</p>
<p>After imparting these instructions, Lonoikoualii allowed Aukelenuiaiku to go on his
way to the home of Namakaokahai. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he remained
standing by the doorway, where he was greeted by those within. After the greeting
they invited Aukelenuiaiku to come inside; but he did not enter; he remained there.
By these different things we will see how Aukelenuiaiku’s god was all-powerful, and
we will also see how Aukelenuiaiku obeyed all the instructions that were given him.

<p>While Aukelenuiaiku was standing by the doorway of Namakaokahai’s house, the two women,
Upoho and Haapuainanea, were sent for to come to their queen, and when they arrived,
Namakaokahai ordered them saying; “Use your power and slay him.” At this command,
the two women turned and looked at Aukelenuiaiku. When they saw that it was the young
man they had befriended when they were sent out to look for the person the dog was
barking at, they were so ashamed that they ran off. Upoho, the one with the form of
a rat ran into a hole; Haapuainanea, the lizard woman ran up a tree, and Aukelenuiaiku
was saved. After these two, Moela, the watch-dog of the land was sent for, but when
it came near to Aukelenuiaiku, he opened his mouth wide showing his teeth and then
jumped at Aukelenuiaiku with the <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>intention of tearing him to pieces, but when he touched Aukelenuiaiku he was killed,
reduced to ashes. When the queen saw that her favorite dog was killed, she regretted
his death so much that she bowed her head in grief and wept. After the death of her
dog, she ordered her four brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana, and commanded
them: “Use your power and kill this fellow. Take him and eat him up.” When Aukelenuiaiku
heard this he entered the house. Upon seeing Aukelenuiaiku, the four brothers of Namakaokahai
changed their forms; Kanemoe changed into a rock and he laid at the doorway: Kaneapua
changed into a log of wood and laid there: Leapua changed into a coral rock: Kahaumana
changed into a hard blue rock. These four brothers did this because they were ashamed
of Aukelenuiaiku and they wished to hide themselves. After this Aukelenuiaiku came
to where the calabash vine was growing with several green calabashes on the vine;
he then took one up and opened it and sat down to have his meal, finding food, meat
and water in the green calabash. While Aukelenuiaiku was eating, the brothers of Namakaokahai
said to themselves: “How wonderfully all-seeing is that man. He is eating our food.
Who has told him where to find it? Food has been placed before him but he would not
touch it.” After Aukelenuiaiku had satisfied his hunger and had seen all the things
placed before him, the brothers of Namakaokahai stood up in their human forms.

for that too will mean death to you. If she should ask you to come onto the lounge
made of mats, don’t go up, for that too means your death. You must, therefore, go
and sit by the doorway, and when she finds that you will not respond to her call,
she will come to you at the door. If she should ask you to sleep with her, don’t give
your consent, for you will get killed; but you sit on her breast and give a sigh,
and when she asks of you why you sighed, tell her that you are hungry for something
to eat; and if she should order you to come and get something to eat, obey her, for
your wife is a goddess and not a human being.” These admonitions were satisfactory

you are such a handsome fellow—for you will be killed and eaten up by the bird.” Aukelenuiaiku

in first and reaches out for two men, and after they are devoured the left wing will
come in and take up two more men, then the beak will come down and devour them.” “Which
two men will the bird come for first?” Two of the men replied: “We will be the first.”
“Is the cave very deep?” “Yes, it is quite deep.” Aukelenuiaiku then instructed the

thankful to Aukelenuiaiku, for they knew that they were rescued from a terrible death,

<p>When Aukelenuiaiku and the men reached the bottom [of the cliff], Kiwaha again took
up the rainbow and placed it on the cliff. After this Aukelenuiaiku asked the men:
“What do you want?” They each answered: “I want a piece of sugar-cane.” “I want a
potato.” “I want a banana.” “I want a taro.” Aukelenuiaiku then said to them: “The
sugar-cane is kapued for my son. If any one eats it he will die. So are the potatoes,
the bananas and the taro. So I will advise each of you not to touch these things as
we go on our way, else you will all die.” After giving them this advice they all started
out. On the way, however, the men did not adhere to the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku,
for he who wanted the sugar-cane took a piece and ate it, so he died; the other three
men also took up the things they craved for and they also died. Thus did the four
men die, for not keeping the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku.

<p>One day when Aukelenuiaiku entered the eating house, to have something to eat, while
so doing, Namakaokahai secretly opened the box containing the god of Aukelenuiaiku.
Looking in she saw the axe and the knife. She then took up the axe and ran her fingers
over the edge, cutting her fingers so they bled. Namakaokahai then said: “How strange!
here my husband has some very good things which he is hiding from me!” After looking
over these things she closed the box and put it away. When Aukelenuiaiku finished
his meal he returned and sat down. Namakaokahai then asked him, pretending not to
have seen what was in the box, saying: “Say, what useful things did you bring with
you when you came?” Aukelenuiaiku then picked up the box and opening it, he took out
the axe and knife and gave them over to his wife, saying: “These two things which
I have brought with me from the land of Kuaihelani are very good and useful. These
two things together with my god are the three things of the greatest value.” The wife
then asked him: “What are these things good for?” “The axe will cut a log of wood

it was impossible to kill her, although she was cut up with the axe; by which acts
we will know that she was not human. After talking about the axe and knife, Namakaokahai
said to her husband: “You proceed and cut me into pieces with the axe.” Aukelenuiaiku
said: “How strange of you to ask me to do such a thing as to cut you up, my own wife!
How can I do such a thing, for it will mean your death? Rather let me cut up some
other person with this axe, or my opponent in some fight, not you, my own flesh.”
The wife replied: “You might give this axe to someone else and thus deprive our child
of such a useful thing. Therefore I want you to try it on me.” And because Namakaokahai
insisted on it, the husband finally gave in, whereat she was much pleased. When this
consent was given Namakaokahai stretched out her legs and Aukelenuiaiku severed them

for it was fun to her. Namakaokahai then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Yes, you have a very
useful thing indeed; cut off another portion.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he proceeded
and cut off the calves of the legs, and this cutting was kept on until the head was
also cut off from the body. In this cutting, the several portions of the body of Namakaokahai
were completely severed and separated from each other, but the mouth never ceased
speaking.

<p>After the body of Namakaokahai had been cut up into several pieces, the head asked
of Aukelenuiaiku: “Are these all the useful things my husband brought with him?” “Yes,
these are all; and I am surprised at you, for when a person is cut up in this manner,
death is certain.” Namakaokahai then replied: “If these are all the useful things
you have, I will now show you what I have.” Saying this, the pieces began to get together
of their own accord, and in a short space of time the body was again complete and
restored as before. She then called for her four brothers, Kaneapua, Kanemoe, Leapua
and Kahaumana. Upon their arrival the sister asked them: “What shall I change myself
into? Shall it be into a cliff?” Her brothers then answered: “Yes, change yourself
into a cliff.” At that very moment a great, high cliff stood before them, smooth and
straight up and down, where the koae<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5332src" href="#xd32e5332">19</a> was seen flying. Aukelenuiaiku looked at it and touched its smooth sides with his
hands with fear and great excitement. He next saw Namakaokahai, his wife, standing
on the very top of the cliff; then he saw her looking down at him, and she called:
“What are you doing?” The husband replied: “I am admiring your supernatural powers.
Your useful things together with mine will be a great inheritance for our child.”
In making this reply, Aukelenuiaiku made believe that he was not afraid; but in fact
he was almost overcome with fear.

<p>That night, after Namakaokahai had retired to their sleeping house, Aukelenuiaiku
and his brothers-in-law went into another house and there he was given his lessons
in the art of flying. They first taught him how to jump and how to fly to certain
places; then they asked him to jump to the top of a shelf. After he was successful
in this he was requested to jump to the top roof batten of the house. Aukelenuiaiku
then jumped and held it for a while, then fell to the floor. In this falling, Namakaokahai
heard it, and she got up and came to her brothers’ house, and asked them: “What are
you doing?” “We are learning how to box.” “What is that?” “It is played this way.
Kanemoe stands up like this on this side, and Kaneapua stands up on that side; then
they strike at each other, and the one who gets hit real hard falls to the floor.
That was the noise you heard.” When Namakaokahai heard this she said: “I see that
my husband has some good thing hidden that he has not shown me. How mysterious you
are!” After this Namakaokahai returned to her own house. After she disappeared, Aukelenuiaiku
again made another attempt to reach the top batten, but again he was unsuccessful
and he fell to the floor. <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>Namakaokahai again heard this and she came to her brothers’ house and asked them:
“I believe you are teaching my husband how to fly.” “No, we are wrestling.” “How is
that done?” “One stands up on this side, and one on the other side; they then take
ahold of one another and each tries to throw the other down. The one who is thrown
down made the noise you heard.” Because of this satisfactory reply Namakaokahai again
retired to their house. After she was gone, Aukelenuiaiku again made another attempt
and this time he was successful. He next came out and flew to the top of the house,
and in this he was again successful. From the roof Aukelenuiaiku flew up into the
sky, and he went so high that his brothers-in-law were unable to see him. After a

<p>When Aukelenuiaiku found that he was able to fly he was then in possession of all
the powers held by his wife. After this the two lived on in peace and they never went
out of sight of each other; they were indeed a loving couple. It also became apparent
that Namakaokahai, his god-wife, was with child. Before its birth, however, Namakaokahai
made known to her husband the name of the child: it was Kauwilanuimakehaikalani<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5367src" href="#xd32e5367">22</a> (the lightning which we see in a rain-storm). Aukelenuiaiku, however, wished to have
the child called after the name of his god Lonoikoualii.

she called her brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. As they stood in
her presence, she said to them: “You go up to my uncle and cousin, Kuwahailo and Makalii,
and inform them that I have given unto my husband all my possessions. The things above,
below, in the uplands, in the lowlands, the drift iron, the iron<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5383src" href="#xd32e5383">23</a> that stands in the earth, the whale’s tooth, the (ea) turtle shell, the things that

<p>After Namakaokahai had delivered her orders to her brothers, they began their flight,
going as far as the top of the mountains where they rested. In this first flight Aukelenuiaiku
went on to heaven, reaching his wife’s place, a most sacred sphere, not accessible
to anyone. Although they flew at the same time with Aukelenuiaiku, he got ahead of
his brothers-in-law and arrived in heaven first. While Aukelenuiaiku was standing
in the sacred place of Namakaokahai, he was seen by Kuwahailo, who said to himself:

<p>In this flight to heaven, Aukelenuiaiku did not think that he was going to meet anyone
who would oppose him, and consequently he went along unguarded; but through the powers
of his god Lonoikoualii he was warned in time, for the god called out to him: “Say,
Aukelenuiaiku, watch or else we will be killed, for I see that we are going to be
attacked. Put on your garment of ashes and cover yourself from head to feet; don’t
be slow or we will be killed.” By this warning Aukelenuiaiku knew that a conflict
was about to begin, and he immediately put on his war pau. As soon as his god finished
giving the warning a bolt of fire was sent out from the hand of Kuwahailo and the
land began to be in flames. The name of this bolt of fire was Kukuena. After which
a large black rock was sent out, called Ikuwa, the thunder. When these things came
in contact with the robe of ashes of Aukelenuiaiku, they became as nothing, like chaff
and were blown away by the wind.

<p>In this story it was said that when the thunderbolt came in contact with the garment
of Aukelenuiaiku it caused the roaring and rumbling of the thunder which is heard
to this day. After the bolt of fire was extinguished and the rock became as nothing,
Kuwahailo looked at Aukelenuiaiku and lo, he was still in the place where he saw him,
still alive. This grieved Kuwahailo heavily: it bode dire trouble that his enemy,
the defiant<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5404src" href="#xd32e5404">24</a> of Kuaihelani, should stand alive before him. After a time he sent another bolt of
fire, called Mahuia, and another rock, called Welehu, the second strongest bolt of
thunder. The roar was deafening, the heaven rocked, the foundations of the earth were
shaken, the waves of the ocean rose high as mountains, large rocks were loosened from
the cliffs, the cliffs were opened up and the birds on the mountain heights were alarmed.

<p>We will here leave Aukelenuiaiku and Kuwahailo for a time while we take up the brothers
of Namakaokahai. In making their flight from the earth to heaven, they saw that Aukelenuiaiku
was going much faster than they were. The length of time they took on this voyage
was five days and five nights, while Aukelenuiaiku covered the distance in only one
day and one night: hence, when Kuwahailo was pouring out his death-dealing bolts,
the brothers were still on their way. When they were approaching heaven, and saw from
a distance the fire-bolt called Kukuena, and the black rock Ikuwa being hurled at
Aukelenuiaiku, they all cried out in alarm, for they thought their brother-in-law
would be killed. They then flew to a rocky valley and there laid down; after the fire
and the roar of the thunder had gone by they came out, and when they looked they saw
Aukelenuiaiku still standing. They then called to him to come and hide himself between
the rocks in the valley, for they knew that other death-dealing bolts were yet to
come; but Aukelenuiaiku answered them: “You stay there where you are while I remain
here until I shall kill Kuwahailo.” As soon as the last death-bolt had passed by,
the nephews of Kuwahailo came out and stood in the presence of their uncle. He then
asked them: “How is your sister?” “She is at home.” “And whence comes this wizard?”
“That is your nephew, the husband of Namakaokahai.” When Kuwahailo heard this from
his nephews, he stood there in fear and trembling, and wondered what he was to do
to his nephew Aukelenuiaiku, the hero<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5414src" href="#xd32e5414">25</a> of Kuaihelani. After a pause of some time he said to Aukelenuiaiku: “My nephew, I
have indeed sinned against you, for I have this day treated you unkindly. I will therefore
make an offering before you of eight hundred men.” When Kuwahailo returned with his
eight hundred men, and they stood before Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku turned to Kuwahailo
and asked him: “What are these men for?” His uncle replied: “They are my offerings
to you.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Leave the men for your grandnephew and as people
for the land.”

was a very beautiful woman. Her skin, to look upon her, was red as fire. On coming
out of her house, her beauty overshadowed the rays of the sun, so that darkness covered
the land, and the red rain would be seen approaching; the fog would also come, and
after these things had been seen the fine rain would come, then the red waters would
flow and the lightning would play in the heavens. After these things, then the form

off his mind and he remembered his nephew and brothers, so he wept aloud. While Aukelenuiaiku

got quite close to Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku attempted to catch <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>it; when he did this it disappeared. At this his wife said: “You will not be able
to save your nephew now, because you acted too hastily. Had you obeyed my instructions,
he would have been brought to life again. Now the spirit of your nephew is dead.”
When Aukelenuiaiku heard this from his wife, he became down-hearted and believed what
his wife told him, that the spirit of his nephew was now beyond recovery. Aukelenuiaiku
therefore refused to take food for five days and five nights; he would not touch either
food or water, and he denied himself everything, for he was so sorry for his nephew.
When Namakaokahai saw her husband refuse to take food she asked him: “Why have you
refused to take food?” Her husband replied: “You know quite well why I have refused
food, my wife; that is, the spirit of my nephew. I will not take food until my days
of grief are over; then I will again take food.”

<p>Because of this reply made by her husband, sadness entered the heart of Namakaokahai
for him; so she said to her husband: “If you have great strength and courage, then
your nephew and brothers will have some chance of coming back to life again; but if
your courage fails you, then they will never be restored to life again.” Aukelenuiaiku
then asked his wife: “What is it that I must do with my strength and courage?” “In

heard that it was possible to save his nephew and brothers. After he had taken food,
Aukelenuiaiku said to his wife: “Where is the road that will lead me to the water
of everlasting life of Kane?” His wife replied: “I will show you the way. From this

land in search of the water of life of Kane. The wife then said to her husband: “On
this direct line you must go without once departing from it. You must not go towards
the right, for you will then be wandering in the sky and die. You must not go to the
left of this line, for you will then fall into space and you will be lost. All these
instructions you must keep in your mind.” As soon as his wife concluded with her instructions,
Aukelenuiaiku took up the box which contained his god Lonoikoualii, put it under his
arm and then put on his robe of ashes. When Aukelenuiaiku was ready to proceed on
his journey, he fell on his wife’s neck and they kissed each other, and then made
his flight toward the rising sun.

<p>In this flight, Aukelenuiaiku did not fly within the straight limits given him, so
he fell into space and he grew weaker and weaker until he was almost dead. In this
long flight, the arm under which the box containing the god was held, became so tired
that he changed the box under the other arm; in doing this the god Lonoikoualii saw
for the first time that they had departed from the direct line shown them by Namakaokahai.
Lonoikoualii then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “We are flying outside of the limits given
us and not on the line. The fire is burning there on the earth and I see everybody
has gone down below except one person.” Aukelenuiaiku asked: “Who is it that is still
up here?” Lonoikoualii, his god, replied: “That thing stationed up there; fly for
it and hold it fast, and then we will be saved.”
</p>
<p>The object which the god Lonoikoualii referred to was the grandfather of Namakaokahai,
Kaukihikamalama, the moon. The reason why he was later than the <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>others in obeying the summons of his granddaughter was because he was delayed in preparation
of food for him on the way to the earth. But before he was ready to come he was held
by Aukelenuiaiku, and because of this fact we now see the moon not quite as bright
as it used to be. It was because Aukelenuiaiku held it so tightly. Anyway, that is
the reason given in this story.

he lit on Kanenaenae. At the end of the questions and answers relating to the parents
of Aukelenuiaiku, Kanenaenae then knew that he was connected to Aukelenuiaiku, and
he therefore fell on him and wept. At the end of the weeping he asked Aukelenuiaiku:
“What has brought my lord here?” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “I have come for the water
of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and brothers.” Kanenaenae then asked: “Is
it not all gone?” “No, it is not all gone.” “Yes, you shall have it. Look straight

to get it. You must therefore fly along this way. In this flight downward you will
meet your grandfather who will direct you how to get to this water of life.”

<p>After receiving these instructions, Aukelenuiaiku continued on his flight and flew
along until he lit on Kuemanu. After the several questions had been asked and the
usual answers given, Aukelenuiaiku said: “I am your own offspring.” The guard then
asked: “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” When Kuemanu heard
this he wept over Aukelenuiaiku and then asked: “Are you the grandson of Kapoino and
Kamooinanea?” Aukelenuiaiku assented, saying: “Yes, I am their grandchild.” Kuemanu
then asked: “What thing of such importance is it that has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku
replied: “I have come in search of the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew
and brothers.” “Yes, you shall get it. You must go down to your grandaunt, who is
down there at the base of the cliff, Luahinekaikapu, who is blind. When you come to
her, you will find her roasting bananas, four in number. When she reaches out to take
one up, you also reach and take one; do this until the last ones are taken. Then when
she reaches out for the others and fails to find them and asks, ‘What <span class="corr" id="xd32e5561" title="Source: mischievious">mischievous</span> fellow is this that has come?’ and receives no reply, she will take up the ashes
and sprinkle them to her right; you must then run over to her left side. And when
she sprinkles the ashes on her left side, you must run to her right side. After this
you want to watch her as she takes up the ashes and smells of it. If she should do
this, then she will discover you; then be very careful or the old woman will kill
you. Look out for another attack, for she will then take up one of her clubs which
is used for beating kapas and strike at you with it, when you must run to her left
side; and when she strikes to her left, run to her right. After you have overcome
all these things, then you must run and climb on to her back and sit there.”

<p>After the old woman had exhausted all her attempts to dispose of her opponent, Aukelenuiaiku
then climbed on to her lap, when she asked: “Whose conceited child art thou?” Aukelenuiaiku
replied: “Your own.” “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” When
the grandaunt heard this, she again asked of Aukelenuiaiku: “Are you, then, the grandchild

I cannot see. I may not be able to give you the water of everlasting life of Kane.”
By these words of his grandaunt, Aukelenuiaiku began to be doubtful about getting
what he wished, and for a moment he did not know what to do. At last he said to his
grandaunt: “Let us go outside.” When she heard this she assented and she was led out
by Aukelenuiaiku and was made to lie down under a coconut tree. Aukelenuiaiku then
climbed up the coconut tree and picked off two young shoots of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>coconut, and then called to his grandaunt: “Say, Luahinekaikapu, turn your face toward
the sky.” When the old woman heard this she turned her face up as directed. Aukelenuiaiku
then threw with much force the two young shoots at the eyes of Luahinekaikapu.

<p>When these struck her in the eyes, she jumped up and cried with a loud voice: “Oh!
I am killed.” Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her: “Don’t cry, be quiet; rub your
eyes, they may open up and you will then be able to see.” When the old woman heard
this call from her grandchild, she began rubbing her eyes. After doing this her sight
was restored and she was able to see as before. Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her:

they will give you contains the bitter water; throw that away and reach in again,

reaching in they were surprised, for they had never seen such a thing before. Being
surprised, they hesitated for a while to study what they should do. The guards then
took up some food and placed it into the hands of Aukelenuiaiku, but the hands dropped
the food; they then placed some fish in the hands, and still the fish was dropped.
The guards then wondered what the hand was reaching for. Finally one of the guards
said: “Perhaps the hands are after the water of life of Kane.” One of the other guards

<p>We will here pause for a moment in speaking of Aukelenuiaiku and let us take up Kamohoalii.
When Aukelenuiaiku entered the lama grove and he became entangled with the trees,
the sound of the breaking lama was carried to the ears of Kamohoalii, but not being
certain as to the direction from which the sound came, he listened for two months.
At the end of the two months he heard the sound of the breaking of the loulu palm
leaves, so Kamohoalii knew that the person who had entered these groves was traveling
from the bottom of the hole upwards. This he was quite sure, because the sound of
the loulu palm leaves was like the sound of thunder; the lama was like the sound of
a shell, and the sound of the bamboo was like the beating of the waves against a cliff.
By these different sounds and the rotation in which they sounded, Kamohoalii was able
to know that the person was on his way out of the hole. Therefore he enquired of those
who were guarding the water-gourd, Huawaiakaula: “Where is the water-gourd and the
net outside of the gourd?” The guard replied: “You came and took it some time ago.”

Kane for his nephew and older brothers.” When Kamohoalii heard this, he said: “He
is a wicked fellow. That is not the proper thing for a cousin to do; he should have
come and seen me on the matter, and not steal it. I don’t blame him for taking the
water of life, but he has ill-used our grandmother, Huawaiakaula, and our grandfather
Paleaikalanalana.” This was because Aukelenuiaiku had broken off the neck of the water

were destroyed, he poured out the water of life into the sea until it was almost all
gone, leaving only about half of the water. While Aukelenuiaiku was pouring out the
water of life, Namakaokahai saw her husband doing this, and she knew that the restoration
of the nephew and brothers was not succeeding. She therefore called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku,
come home.” When Aukelenuiaiku arrived in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>presence of his wife, she said: “You are very foolish,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5649src" href="#xd32e5649">40</a> my husband. It was for you to go in search of the water, and when you had found it
I would use it, and in so doing bring back to life your nephew and older brothers.
But instead of this, you have come back and acted ignorantly. Had you poured out all
the water, your nephew and older brothers could never have been restored to life.”

<p>In thus giving away his wife and lands, Aukelenuiaiku reserved nothing for himself,
and he therefore became like a dependent. While living in this humble way his one
occupation was to go down to the seashore daily with a rod and spend his time fishing,
and in time he became an expert. In his daily trips out rod fishing he often met Pele
and Hiiaka, cousins of Namakaokahai. In their meetings Aukelenuiaiku began to admire
the two girls, and he spent more of his time with them than he did at fishing. In
time Aukelenuiaiku could do but very little fishing, for the desire to see the two
girls, Pele and Hiiaka, was his greatest pleasure, and after a time he became infatuated
with them and thought of very little else but the features of Pele and Hiiaka, and
he found himself oftener with them than anywhere else.

<p>We have seen that Namakaokahai had altogether become the property of his brothers,

she loved him still and held him as dear to her as before.

<p>At nights while at home, Aukelenuiaiku thought of nothing else but his two companions,
and so each morning he would take up his line, hook and rod, and pretend to be very
busy with them as though they needed overhauling. In doing this Aukelenuiaiku wanted
to make his wife, Namakaokahai, believe that he was really very much taken up with
his pastime, that of fishing, and in that way keep his wife from suspecting him. Aukelenuiaiku
was absent once for three whole days on one of his fishing trips, and the wife began
to suspect that something was wrong. Before this it was his usual custom to go out
early in the morning, and after dark would come home; but this time he forgot to dry
out his fish-line as before. When his wife saw this she became suspicious, and knowing
that his wife knew his neglect about drying out his fish-line, he was very much depressed.

<p>The day after this Aukelenuiaiku as usual took up his rod and proceeded to the seashore;
and toward evening he returned home. Before he started home, however, he soaked his
fish-line and hook into the water so as to make his wife believe that he had really
been fishing. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he began to arrange his hook
and line, and as he was at it for some time, his wife said: “It would be all right
to be constantly occupied with your hook and line if you caught any fish; then those
at home would get some. Here you do nothing else but work on your hook and line, and
yet you never bring any fish home. What a waste of time!” The husband replied: “Do
you think, my wife, that the fish is something you can catch with your hands in the
sea so that I could bring them home all the time? Don’t you know that the line and
hook are all I have in the matter, and not the bringing of the fish? That is entirely
with the fish whether to bite at my hook or not.” Shortly after this conversation
Aukelenuiaiku again started out fishing, and late that evening he returned with two
small fish called aloiloi.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5682src" href="#xd32e5682">41</a> The wife then said to him: “How strange of you to go all day and return at night,

<p>On his next trip Aukelenuiaiku met with a queer<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5690src" href="#xd32e5690">42</a> experience. His body was bitten all over, while his neck was all scratched up, and
in places it was cut. On this evening he again came home with two more small fish.
On reaching the house Namakaokahai looked at her husband’s body and neck and saw that
he was all scratched. She then spoke in parables saying: “Yes, there are two kinds
of fish in the sea that bite: the shark and the eel.” Then she continued: “Strange,
that your skin is all bitten and your neck scratched, but you don’t return with any
sharks and eels.”
</p>
<p>Aukelenuiaiku then said with great cunning: “I met with a queer experience today.
When I arrived at the seashore I tied the bait to my hook and cast it into the sea.
After I had let the line down it got caught in the coral down below, and so I dived
down and after getting the line loose I came up. I was not at all hurt at this time.
But on casting my line the second time it again got tangled and I dived the second
time. After this it was caught the third time and again I went down, but before I
had gone very far I got the cramps and I was carried by the current away down to the
bottom where I was rubbed against the coral until my back was all cut up. After this
I recovered myself and swam up, and this time I was caught in an eel hole, and there
I was rolled about by the surf until I was almost out of breath. Had I been a boy
from the backwoods I would have been killed, and you would not have known how, and
how pitiful that would have been.”

in several places. When Namakaokahai saw how her husband was all cut up, <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>and how he had disregarded her words of advice, she grew less angry of him and transferred

<p>We will here see how Namakaokahai ill-treated her own cousins, her own flesh and blood.
When Namakaokahai’s anger was aroused she seized her cousins and gave them a severe
beating. When the brothers saw this they jumped in to help the girls, but this interference
was of no avail, for Namakaokahai gave her brothers some of the beating, and she gave
them so much that they all had a hard time to save themselves. Because of this the
cousins rose and departed to some other place to dwell; but Namakaokahai followed
them and again drove them away. The cousins in the meantime thought that she would
forget the cause of her anger, but she followed after them and drove them away from
their new home. At this persistency on their cousin’s part, they vowed that they would
never again turn back, nor ever again live in the same land with their cousin. At
this expulsion, the two sisters studied where they would move to, and after considering
several places they decided on Kauai and there make their future home. In this journey,
when they reached Kauai,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5718src" href="#xd32e5718">44</a> where they made their home, they had an idea that their cousin would leave them in
peace and not follow them up. The place where Pele and Hiiaka took up as their first
home on Kauai was at Puukapele, a place to the east of Mana. When they settled at
this place they started a fire whose glare was seen from the high peaks in the land
of Nuumealani, where Namakaokahai was stationed on the lookout for her cousins. The
height of these peaks was probably as high as that of Kaala mountain.

<p>When Namakaokahai saw the glare of the fire on Kauai, she knew that Pele and Hiiaka
were there, so she followed on to Kauai where she met her cousins and another fight
was had. In this fight Pele and Hiiaka almost overcame their cousin, but being possessed
of great strength Namakaokahai was enabled to overcome her cousins. Therefore, being

<p>Upon their arrival on Oahu, Pele and Hiiaka took up their abode in Kealiapaakai, at
Moanalua, where they dug down into the ground and made a home. On coming from Kauai
they brought some red dirt and some salt with them and deposited these things in their
new home. Because of this fact these places were given the names of Kealiapaakai and
Kealiamanu. Upon finding that the place was too shallow they went to settle at Leahi.
While living at Leahi they tried digging down into the place, but again found it too
shallow. The two then moved on to Molokai and settled down at Kalaupapa. After a time
they began digging and were again disappointed in striking water; so they left Molokai.
The hole they dug was called Kauhako. From Molokai they journeyed to Haleakala in
Maui. Upon their arrival at this place they began digging a pit which they left open
on the top of the mountain. The rocks<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5725src" href="#xd32e5725">45</a> in Hanakaieie, at Kahikinui, are those that were dug up by Pele and Hiiaka.

its literal translation. A treatise by Fornander on the phrase has the following:
“The prayers of the Hawaiian priests, offered in the temples, as well as those offered
at private sacred places, or in family worship, invariably closed with the ejaculation
Amama, equivalent to Amen. Amama, as a verb, means ‘to offer in sacrifice.’ It does
not occur in any other Polynesian dialect that I am acquainted with.… I therefore
consider it to be a foreign word imported into the language in far remote times.…
It was a formula employed on occasions of worship in imitation of his teachers, but
without any inherent sense derived from his own language, as multitudes of Christians
today use the word Amen without knowing its origin or sense. That the Hawaiians employed
<i lang="haw">Amama</i> as a verb, ’to offer in sacrifice’ I look upon as a later adaptation when the primary
sense of the word, if ever known, had been forgotten.” His note on the phrase <i lang="haw">Amama, ua noa</i>, in Pol. Race, Vol. II, p. 178, says: “Literally it means ‘it is offered, the tabu
is taken off, or the ceremony is ended.’ ”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e5237src" title="Return to note 16 in text.">↑</a></p>

his suit was being rejected, that of Moikeha’s was being accepted, he thereupon made
up his mind to sow discord between her and her lover, and in that way persuade Luukia
to be separated from Moikeha.

Mua then remarked to Luukia: “You must not for one moment think that that cheering

him as in days gone by. Luukia thereupon ordered her immediate attendants to lash

with a fine rope from her waist to the middle of her thighs, and the ends of the rope
were then fixed in such a way as to make them almost impossible to be found. This

that anything wrong had taken place in his domestic affairs; but in this he was disappointed.
Upon Moikeha’s arrival at home he met Luukia, and although there was some small change
in his reception, still on the whole he was treated in the usual manner, Luukia entering
into conversation with him. It was only after Moikeha had discovered that Luukia had
been lashed that she ceased speaking to him. Immediately upon arriving at the palace,
Moikeha saw that there was something wrong by Luukia’s countenance, and he at once

<p>That night, while in their preparation to retire, Moikeha was surprised at seeing
Luukia retiring with her pau still on, something entirely unusual with her, she not
having done anything of the kind during their peaceful days. Moikeha, however, did
not show his surprise by any utterance, but bided his own time for four nights with
the determination if possible to find out the cause of this extraordinary behavior
on the part of Luukia. On the fourth night Moikeha saw no change, Luukia still wore
the pau on retiring. The next night, Moikeha, with a desire to ascertain the cause
of this queer behavior, undertook to unfasten the pau, and after it was unfastened
he saw that Luukia had been corded from her waist to the middle of her thighs. Upon
making this discovery, Moikeha asked Luukia why she had done this, but she made no
reply. From evening until midnight Moikeha urged her to tell him the cause of this
lashing, but she utterly refused to even say one word. All through the rest of the
night Moikeha pondered over this recent change that came over Luukia and said to himself:
“Your actions are indeed strange. Here we have been living right along in peace, and
now you will not even speak to me. What fault have I committed that you should cause
yourself to be lashed in this manner? Very well then, I am going to absent myself
from you and shall go to some other land, and thus give you a chance to have your
wish fulfilled.”

thoughts were carried back to his son Laamaikahiki, his child with Kapo, and he began
to have a yearning desire to see Laamaikahiki. So at a given time he called his five
sons together and said to them: “I am thinking of sending one of you boys to go to
your elder brother and bring him to Hawaii.” Upon hearing the wish of their father,
the boys became greatly excited and they all spoke out: “Let me go! Let me go!!” and
so on. This was carried on for some time.

<p>When Moikeha saw that his sons were excited and were so worked up that there was much
contention among them, he devised a way of giving them a test at something, to determine
who should go to Tahiti. Upon deciding what the nature of the test was to be, he called
his sons to him and said: “I have decided to give you a test, and the boy who shall
excel over the others, he shall be the one to go and bring <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>your brother.” He then took the boys to the river in the order of their birth. But
before this he told his sons: “Let each of you bring his ti-leaf canoe<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6516src" href="#xd32e6516">6</a> and sail it across the river, each one to have but one trial, and under no condition

that boy shall be the one to go and bring your brother.”

<p>After giving them these instructions he proceeded to the opposite bank of the river
and sat down at the edge of the water directly facing the wind. The boys in the meantime
proceeded to the windward at a point right opposite their father. The oldest boy then
set his canoe down in the water and steered it for the desired point, but it missed
the mark, as it sailed off in another direction. The second boy then set his canoe
down in the water and it, too, missed the mark. The third and fourth boys also took

<p>At last, when it was almost time for Kila to undertake his trip to Tahiti, to bring
Laamaikahiki, Moikeha then thought of giving him the desired permission to accompany
his older brothers. Upon deciding that he would do this Moikeha told Kila: “My son,
I am not going to keep you away from your brothers any longer. You can now accompany
them. It is possible that the journey you are to undertake may take you away from
them altogether, so you may now accompany them wherever they go. After the kapu days
of the temple are ended, in the following days you shall then sail for Tahiti.” Kila
then replied: “You must not permit me to accompany my brothers for I might get killed.
I think you ought to provide them with a god so that they will fear the god and in
that way prevent them from killing me. Then I think it will be safe for me to accompany
my brothers.” When Moikeha saw that the boy had used good judgment in the matter,
he called his sons together and told them that they must now have a god. Upon hearing
this the boys would not consent to such a proposition. At this Moikeha approved of
Kila’s discretion and therefore refused to allow him to accompany his brothers in
their excursions.

<p>Shortly after this Moikeha proceeded to get everything in readiness for Kila’s voyage
to Tahiti as was formerly planned by him. Before he set out for Tahiti, Moikeha advised
him as follows: “When you sail from here, go by way of Oahu, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>don’t fail to call on your aunts; they are living on the side of Oahu facing Molokai.

<p>After imparting these words of advice, Moikeha picked out the men who were to accompany
Kila on this voyage. Kamahualele was selected as his companion, he being Moikeha’s
foster-son. Kapahi and Moanaikaiaiwa, were selected as the paddlers. Kipunuiaiakamau
and his companion were selected as the navigators and sailing masters. In case the
canoe was likely to run aground, Kamahualele would call out: “Kipunuiaiakamau, hold
on!” Then he and his companion would back water and the canoe would go backwards.
This is the reason why these two men were named Kipunuiaiakamau. Kaukaukamunolea and
his companion, two of them, were selected as pilots. These were the men that were
selected to accompany Kila on his voyage to Tahiti.
</p>
<p>When he was about ready to set sail, some of the Kauai people expressed their desire
to accompany him on his voyage, Hooholoku and his companion. And upon the expressed
wish of Kamahualele he was permitted to take Kuaiwilu and Kauineno, making about nine

in the presence of Kila. Kamahualele then spoke to Kila: “Let us delay undertaking
our voyage home for a while, for I believe it best to do so, and in the meantime let

him what he should do in order to find Laamaikahiki. “In one day from now you shall
find Laamaikahiki in the mountain of Kapaahu. When we hear the beating of the drum,
Hawea, the drum which belongs to your father, Moikeha, then you must take a human
being and sacrifice him on the altar at Lanikeha, your father’s temple; then you will
be able to see your brother, for it is a sign of sacrifice when that drum is beaten
during the kapu nights. Tomorrow night is the night when the kapu is most strict of
all nights, and it has always been so from your father’s time.”

the mua and Kila went in and hid himself where Kuhelepolani had instructed him. As
soon as he entered the mua, Kuhelepolani rose and walked away from the mua, as it
was the law that women should keep away from such places. Women were forbidden to
be near the kapu houses. Not very long after Kila had entered the mua, Laamaikahiki
came in and went and stood near the drum, where he remained awaiting for the arrival
of the priests before the prayer was to be recited. Shortly after this the priests
who were to join in the recital of the prayer with the chief entered. As soon as the
priests entered, one of them offered a prayer, at the close of which they made their
preparation for the recital.

<p>Upon the arrival of Laamaikahiki and Kila, Laamaikahiki was taken by the hand by the
high priest of Kauai, Poloahilani, to the temple together with his god Lonoikaoualii.
It is said that Laamaikahiki was the first person who brought idols to Hawaii.

<p>Laamaikahiki lived in Kauai for a time, when he moved over to Kahikinui in Maui. This
place was named in honor of Laamaikahiki. As the place was too windy, Laamaikahiki
left it and sailed for the west coast of the island of Kahoolawe, where he lived until
he finally left for Tahiti. It is said that because Laamaikahiki lived on Kahoolawe,
and set sail from that island, was the reason why the ocean to the west of Kahoolawe
is called “the road to Tahiti”.

<p>After Laamaikahiki had lived on Kahoolawe for a time, his priests became dissatisfied
with the place, so Laamaikahiki left Kahoolawe and returned to Kauai. Upon the death

<p>When he became king of Kauai and had taken charge of things just as his father had
done before him, he saw that his reign was not going to be as peaceable as he would
like to have it, as his brothers were jealous of his being made the king of Kauai.
This jealousy on the part of the brothers, coupled with their hatred of him for having
been sent to Tahiti, made them feel all the more bitter against him. However, with
all this bitter feeling entertained by his brothers, all his commands during any of
the large undertakings were always obeyed, they not having the courage to refuse to
obey the orders of the king. But with all this obedience on their part, Kila’s reign
was not altogether satisfactory. The older brothers often met secretly to consult
one another as to the best way of concealing their hatred and bitter feelings from
their brother. At one of these meetings they adopted a certain course and decided
to draw Kila into consenting to do a certain thing, although it was several days after
the proposition was matured, in the following way:

the bones of our father were neglected and they disappeared.” After this Hinauu and
her sister traveled around Kauai mourning for Kila, in which the common people also
joined with them.

<p class="first">When Kila and his brothers arrived at Waipio, Hawaii, and his brothers saw that he
was fast asleep, Umalehu ordered his younger brothers Kaialea, Kekaihawewe and Luakapalala,
to launch the canoe. This order the younger brothers obeyed. After the canoe was launched
the paddlers jumped aboard, first followed by the young chiefs.
</p>
<p>While this was going on Kila heard the bumping of the canoe, so he sat up and saw
that the canoe was floating in the sea. Believing that his brothers would come for
him later on, he did not watch them very closely. But when he looked again he saw
that the canoe was outside of the line of breakers. He then called out to them: “How
about me? How about me?” Umalehu then answered back: “Wait awhile until we come back
for you.” But he saw that they were to disappear beyond the <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>point of the cliff of Maluo, and a few moments later they disappeared altogether.
Kila therefore remained on the sand of Waipio.
</p>
<p>Kila was spared through the intervention of Kaialea, Kekaihawewe and Laukapalala,
who also insisted that he be left at Waipio, as it was Umalehu’s intention to kill
him while they were on mid-ocean; but Kaialea and Laukapalala prevailed on their brother
to take Kila to Waipio and leave him there.

<p>After the brothers had gone, Kila remained the rest of the night in meditation, trying
to comprehend the object of his brothers’ actions. Toward morning he fell into a deep
sleep after sitting up most of the night. While he was asleep and the sun was rising
higher and higher, he was seen by the people, who came to admire this handsome young
man who was fast asleep on the sand. At last the people woke him up and asked him
where he had come from and the circumstances of his arrival at this place. He then
told them the whole history of his treatment by his brothers. He was then taken to
the home of one of the men.

<p>During the first part of Kila’s life in Waipio he lived under the people as a servant,
doing everything he was told to do. His constant labors consisted of farming and the
cooking and the preparation of the food for his masters. He lived in this lowly life
for a period of about three years. At times he was told by the people with whom he
was living to bring firewood from the top of the cliff, when he would climb to the
top of Puaahuku. During one of his climbs to the top of this cliff, he was seen by
a priest who was living in the temple of Pakaalana, by means of the constant appearance
of a rainbow<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6679src" href="#xd32e6679">10</a> that hung over this cliff. Upon seeing this sign, the priest determined to find out
if this sign was indeed the sign of a high chief. But he was not able to see the sign
every day, however, as Kila did not always go to the top of the cliff, only doing
this at certain times, when he was in quest of firewood.

<p>Shortly after this Kila was accused by his masters of breaking certain kapus. It was
reported to his masters that he had eaten certain food that was kapued, being reserved
for the gods. But Kila was entirely innocent of the charge, so in order to save himself
he ran and entered the place of refuge within the temple of Pakaalana,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6684src" href="#xd32e6684">11</a> a place where the violators of any kapu could be saved from punishment. As he entered
the temple the priest again noticed the sign he saw on the cliff of Puaahuku. Upon
seeing this the priest spoke to Kunaka, who was king of Waipio at this time and who
had reigned ever since Olopana sailed for Tahiti, saying: “You must take that boy
as our son. That boy is no commoner, he is a high chief.” In accordance with the words
of the priest, the king obeyed and he took Kila to be his son, and gave him the name
of Lena.

<p>Shortly after this, during the time of Hua, when the saying, “The bones of Hua are
bleached in the sun” was realized, during a spell of great drought, when a great famine
was experienced over all the lands from Hawaii to Kauai, all the wet lands were parched
and the crops were dried up on account of the drought, so that nothing even remained
in the mountains. Waipio was the only land where the water had not dried up, and it
was the only land where food was in abundance; and the people from all parts of Hawaii
and as far as Maui came to this place for food. Because of this drought all the lands
from Hawaii to Kauai were without food and the people were forced to subsist on mosses
and other such things. But all through the drought and famine Waipio never went without
food. During this famine the people from Hawaii, Maui and other islands came to get

mothers determined to ask them one by one, to see if there was not a chance to persuade

<p class="first">In due course of time after setting sail for Waipio, Kaialea and his men arrived at
their destination. Just prior to their arrival, however, Kila issued an order throughout
the length and breadth of the land, that no one should give any food away upon pain
of death. If a landlord gave away food the land would be taken away from him, and
so on down the line. As Kaialea and his men were approaching land Kila recognized
his double canoe and immediately made up his mind that his brothers must be on it.
When the canoe was beached, Kila saw his brother. In order, therefore, to make sure
that the crime committed against him was really intentional, he ordered his officers
to confiscate the canoe of Kaialea.
</p>
<p>The day on which Kaialea arrived was one of the kapu days, when no canoes were allowed
to be seen at sea, so when the people came and seized his canoe, Kaialea, took it
for granted that it was because of his great crime in breaking the kapu, and he immediately
remembered his mother’s as well as his brothers’ orders about not remaining <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>too long on Hawaii, so he wondered how he was to fulfill their wish, for his canoe
had been confiscated, which left him without means of getting back to Kauai. He also
thought of the needs of the people at home and of their disappointment about his not
coming back in the time allowed him.

was not the name by which he was known in Waipio, however. On the next day some men
were sent by Kila to come for Kaialea and take him to the king’s strong house. When
Kaialea arrived in the presence of the king, he thought he recognized Kila, which

<p>Before they thought of placing Kaialea in confinement, Kila had a talk with one of
his friends and instructed him in the following manner: “When Kaialea is brought here
I will proceed to question him, and in case he does not answer my questions properly
then I will turn him over to you and you must then make a further examination of him.”
So when Kaialea denied ever coming to Hawaii before this, Kila told his friend: “Say,
you must attend to this fellow and question him further on this.” The friend after
looking at Kaialea asked him: “Didn’t you come to Hawaii before this? Didn’t you take
a boy from Waipio with you on that occasion?”
</p>
<p>Upon hearing these questions put to him by Kila’s friend, Kaialea did not wish to
speak of the deed committed by them, for he knew very well of the consequences of
such deeds if known, so he denied having any knowledge of the thing, saying: “We have
not been to this place before; this is the first time I have seen Waipio.” Because
of this answer Kila came out with the question: “Who are your parents?” Again Kaialea
resorted to falsehood and did not give the right names of his parents, for he knew
by the questions put to him that if he told the truth he would be killed.

<p>When Kila heard Kaialea give other than the true names to his parents he gave his
officers the following orders: “Keep this man in confinement until tomorrow, then
put him on the altar and sacrifice him. This is the very man that killed Kila and
left their brother in mid-ocean. Don’t bind him with ropes, however, but let him <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>have free access to the house until such time when I shall give further orders as
to his death, when he shall indeed die.” In accordance with the king’s orders, Kaialea
was taken to the kapu house and there placed in confinement, receiving good treatment
and being supplied with all the food he wanted. But with all this good treatment he
was not able to eat any of the food placed before him, being overcome with grief at
the idea of his being put to death. It was not Kila’s wish, however, to sacrifice
him, but rather to make Kaialea realize the gravity of the evil deed which they had

<p>On the next day, the day when he was to be sacrificed, early that morning, while the
prayers were being said, the note of a mud-hen was heard, when the priests all remarked:
“Something is wrong; the man is saved, because something has happened to interrupt
our recital of the prayer. It is too bad; we were almost at the end when everything
would have been well.” During the morning the priests proceeded to inform the king
of the interruption in the recital of their prayer, when Kila replied: “If the recital
of your prayer has been interrupted, then the man must live; he shall not die today.”
He then sent for his executioner and said: “Don’t put this man on the altar, but take
him and place him in one of the other houses and take good care of him until such
other time when I shall issue further orders as to his death.” So Kaialea was taken
to one of the other outhouses of the king. But he did not give up the idea of being
killed, because he had heard that he was to be sacrificed some day.

<p>While Kaialea was in confinement, this time, Kila often came to ask him questions
touching upon their evil deed. But Kaialea was very stubborn, so he was ordered to
do all kinds of labor. A few days after this, Kila thought of his mother and aunt
and the possibility of their meeting death through hunger, so he gave orders to some
of his men to proceed to Kauai with food. But when these men started out they did
not get as far as Kauai, they only went as far as Kaunakakai, Molokai, and there squandered
all the food in adulterous living. After they had squandered all the food, they returned
to Waipio and reported to Kila that they had delivered the food to his people in Kauai.
Several trips were made by these same men with the purpose of going to Kauai, but
they never once got that far, only going as far as Molokai in each case.

<p>In the meantime the people on Kauai awaited Kaialea’s return. But after a long wait
without hearing anything of him, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister sent a party of men
to come and institute a search for him. On this voyage, the party arrived at Waipio,
Hawaii. Upon their arrival they were asked why they had come, so they replied that
they were in search of a chief, Kaialea by name. On learning the mission of the strangers,
the Waipio people informed them that he had been condemned to be put to death. They
further told the strangers that Kaialea was now in confinement in the temple, and
it had been reported that he was to be sacrificed, but so far no one had seen him
sacrificed, but it was possible that he had been put to death secretly. On the other
hand he might have been thrown in a deep pit.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6729src" href="#xd32e6729">12</a>

<p>In order to make sure of this, Kila ordered his officers to arrest the men and take
them to the temple of Pakaalana. So they were taken by the officers as real prisoners
and were placed in confinement in the same place where Kaialea was being kept. While
this was being done, there was one man left, the man in charge of the canoe. When
he heard what had happened to his companions, and that they had been carried off to
be killed in the temple of Pakaalana, he hid himself in the house where they were
being entertained. A short time after this he met Kaialea’s men and they decided to
return secretly to Kauai. When they were ready to leave, Kaialea’s paddlers told the
people who had befriended them about their going home to Kauai. Their friends, who
really thought a great deal of them, asked them: “Why should you people go home?”
The Kauai people answered: “We cannot stay. If we remain here we would be killed,
for the king does not think kindly of us.” Their friends knew that that what they
had said was quite true, so they gave their consent, being afraid of the troubles
that might follow. On this same day the Waipio people pulled up some taro and loaded
them uncooked onto the canoe that night, and the Kauai people set out on their return

<p class="first">When the men who came in search of Kaialea were being taken to be placed in confinement,
in the same place where he was being held, they began to have all kinds of speculation
as to their probable fate. Upon arriving at the temple they were placed at a little
distance from Kaialea. When he saw them his eyes were filled with tears, while he
tried to control his feelings.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the king’s officers saw him weep they went and told Kila of what they had seen;
so he came to the place where Kaialea was confined and proceeded to question him:
“Are you weeping?” Kaialea replied: “Yes.” Kila again asked him: What are you weeping
for?” Kaialea replied: “I am weeping because I saw the people from my home.” Kila
then went over to where the others were being confined and after a while he came back
to Kaialea, without having spoken to the others, and again asked Kaialea: “Are you
not Moikeha’s son?” Kaialea replied: “No, I am not his son. He is a chief and I am
a common man.” Kila then remarked: “You shall not be released from this place until
you tell me who your parents are. When you have done that, I will then allow you to
return to your home. If you tell me the truth to all the questions that I shall put
to you, you shall be released this very day.”

<p>When Kaialea saw that a chance was given him to get out of his difficulties, he then
told the truth. In the course of Kila’s questions, he asked him: “How many are there
of you from your parents?” Kaialea replied: “There are three of us by <span class="corr" id="xd32e6757" title="Source: Hooipoikamalani">Hooipoikamalanai</span> and Moikeha. There is one older than myself, my mother’s first-born, then myself

<p>By these answers Kila saw that Kaialea had told the truth, so he proceeded to question
him further: “Where is your youngest brother?” Kaialea replied: “He has gone to Tahiti;
he was taken by an older brother, Laamaikahiki.” When Kila heard this he immediately
gave his executive officer the following orders: “Take him and keep him in confinement
in the temple of Pakaalana, because he has not spoken the truth; he says his youngest
brother is in Tahiti.” In obedience to the orders of the chief, Kaialea was taken
into the temple of Pakaalana. After he had been in confinement for a while, Kila again
entered the temple and went and stood at the base of the altar where he could see
Kaialea and said: “Keep him in confinement here until the day when the sacrifices
are to be offered in this temple, when you must take him and offer him as a sacrifice
on the altar.” It was not the intention to sacrifice Kaialea, but said in order to
frighten him, which would probably cause him to tell the truth. Kila then gave orders
to release the other men who had been confined and they returned to the home of the
people who had entertained them before their arrest.

<p>Upon reaching Waipio they were informed this was the day when sacrifices were to be
offered in the temple, and the day when Kaialea was to be sacrificed. As they were
approaching land the people from shore saw a double canoe with its platform<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6772src" href="#xd32e6772">13</a> covered, which was a sign that a chief was aboard. At this same time Kila saw his
mother and aunt and his brothers. So he gave orders that the houses be made ready
to receive them. After they had landed Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu were sent for and
they were brought to the palace of Kunaka, which was near the temple of Pakaalana,
while the brothers of Kila were taken to the other houses apart from their mothers.
</p>
<p>Kila, upon seeing his mother and aunt, endeavored to conceal his feelings and went
to the stream and pretended to take a swim, although it was only to hide his weeping.
Hooipoikamalanai and her sister did not, however, recognize him, for he was somewhat
changed and was now a full-grown man.
</p>
<p>After Kila had had his weeping in the stream, he returned home to meet his mother
and aunt, at the same time keeping himself unknown to them. Hooipoikamalanai and her
sister then spoke to Kila: “We would like to have our sons brought here so that we
may live together in this same place, as we do not want to have them live away from
us.” The brothers were then sent for and they came and lived with their mothers in
the same house. While they were all together Kila asked his mother and aunt: “Have
you any children?” Hooipoikamalanai answered: “Yes, we have children. There are two
of us mothers and one father. We have five children; I have three with our husband.
This one, which is Umalehu, is the first-born; then his brother, Kaialea, who is now
in confinement; and then the youngest, Kila, who is now dead. He was eaten up by a
shark, while on an expedition to Haena with his brothers for the purpose of bringing
back the bones of their father which were to be taken to Tahiti later on. I am still
keeping the hands of my dead son. Hinauu here has two sons with our husband. These
two whom you see here: their names are Kekaihawewe and Laukapalala. When word was
brought to us that Kaialea was to be killed, we decided to come and die with him.
But if you will give your consent that we die in Kaialea’s stead, let him live.”

the king and his chief priests and the people connected with the chief priests came

almost upon us, when the recital of the prayer would end and everything would be satisfactory.
Therefore there will be no sacrifice for the altar today.” Kila, on the other hand,
had known that there would be some interruption in the recital of the prayers that
night, because he did not think Kaialea would be killed.

you still think evil of me. You brought me and left me here while you went home secretly.
I called after you, but you would not turn back. After you had gone I lived as a slave
under some of the Waipio people just for the sake of my living. I obeyed all the orders
given me and went out to labor in the fields, did the cooking, prepared the food and
brought firewood from those cliffs, the cliffs of Puaahuku. In this way did I labor
patiently until I found a father in this person, Kunaka, when my labor for my living
ended and I received my reward. I received the blessing you see me enjoying today
only through my patience. All would have been well if this was the only crime committed
by you. But no; you kidnapped a favorite son from this place; you killed him and took
his hands and gave them to my mother and aunt and told them that they were my hands,
and that I had been eaten up by a shark. As far as your treatment of me is concerned,
I am able to overlook that, but your treatment of one of the favorite sons of Waipio

notes of a kaeke<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6868src" href="#xd32e6868">17</a> flute, which startled them and they rushed out to see where these sounds came from.
When they got outside they saw that these sounds came from aboard of a double canoe.
Upon seeing this the people remarked: “It is the canoe of the god Kupulupulu. These
sounds came from that canoe.” When the people heard that it was Kupulupulu’s canoe
they prepared food and swine as offerings to the god. As soon as it was daylight the
next day the canoe and the people on it were seen, and the people ashore cried out:
“Ye makers of the sounds, here is food and swine; they are offerings for the god.”

<p>Laamakahiki, however, did not make a long stay at Kailikii, when he again set sail,
coming along the Kona coast. On this passage from Kau to Kona, Laamakahiki continued
to beat the drum and play on the flute, and he was accorded the same treatment by
the Kona people as was given him by the people of Kau. It was on this visit that hula
dancing, accompanied by the drum, is said to have been introduced in Hawaii by Laamaikahiki.

<p class="first">It is said that Olopana was once the king of the island of Hawaii, who made his permanent
home in Waipio, where he lived with his wife Luukia. There are, however, three Olopanas
spoken of amongst certain people: The Olopana mentioned in the story of Kamapuaa,
the Olopana said to be of Tahiti, and the Olopana mentioned in this story. But the
Olopana of this story was the Olopana who first went to Tahiti with his wife Luukia,
the same as mentioned in the legend of Moikeha. The genealogy of Olopana cannot be
recounted here, as it is not known. The only things known of Olopana are the events
of his reign on Hawaii and his arrival at Tahiti, which are as follows.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time Olopana and his wife Luukia were the rulers of the island of Hawaii,
and all the people were under them. During their reign a great flood swept down the
valley of Waipio and carried away the people and their houses into the ocean. It is
said that in this flood Olopana and his wife were carried out to sea, which was the
means of their reaching Tahiti. When Moikeha came to Hawaii and spoke of Olopana as
being in Tahiti, the story was then made up that when they were carried out to sea
in the flood, they must have actually swam all the way to Tahiti, as nothing had been
heard of Olopana and his wife from the time of the flood until the arrival of Moikeha.
According to some of the old people, however, it is said and believed that the passage
to Tahiti was made in a canoe.

<p>When the news was first brought here about Olopana being in Tahiti, the people of
Hawaii were so divided in the belief that he was actually alive and in Tahiti that
it was decided, as a means of settling these differences, to send Ulu, the king of
Kau, in a canoe made of bulrushes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6901src" href="#xd32e6901">20</a> After Ulu set out nothing more was heard of him, not even if he had reached Tahiti.
After some time had elapsed a certain priest was sent in search of Ulu, but while
in mid-ocean the priest discovered that Ulu had died, so he returned. Shortly after
the return of the priest, Kapukini, a chief of Puna, was made king of Hawaii, there
being no king over the island of Hawaii at this time.

<p>Olopana in the meantime was living in Tahiti with his wife Luukia. Moikeha and his
wife Kapo were the king and queen of Tahiti at this time. When Moikeha saw that Luukia
was pleasant to look upon he took her to wife, as already spoken of in Chapter I.
After Moikeha left Tahiti and came to Hawaii, Olopana, through his kind and considerate
treatment of the people, became the king of Tahiti. But when Kupohihi, an uncle of
Moikeha, heard that Tahiti had become independent with Olopana as its king, he came
and sent Olopana away. Olopana therefore set sail for Hawaii with his wife Luukia.

<p>Olopana is said to have so treated the people of Tahiti that he and his wife were
thought much of, and when he set out for Hawaii a large number of people accompanied
him. Upon the arrival of Olopana and his companions, the people of Hawaii saw that
their hands and arms were tatued. The people became so infatuated with the idea that
they too had their arms and hands tatued. It is said that this was the first time
that tatuing was introduced into these islands.
</p>
<p>As soon as Olopana and his people arrived from Tahiti, he caused some of his men to
reside on Maui, some on Molokai, and some on Oahu and Kauai. It is said that is the
reason why the people of these islands speak differently from those of Hawaii.
</p>
<p>On their return Olopana and his wife again took up their residence in Waipio, except
at times when Luukia was isolated to other places where she was kept and well treated.
These times of isolation came only at Luukia’s monthly periods, when she <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>was removed to Puukawaiwai, a place located between Kawaihae and Waimea. Here a house
was built for her surrounded by a wall. This particular spot has always been known

<p>It was customary for Luukia to retire to this house of separation at the approach
of her periods of infirmity. During one of her trips to this house of separation,
while on her way from Waipio, Luukia met a man by the name of Waiauwia, a person of
some note who was living at Waimea. This man became so enamoured of her that he followed
her to her house of separation and there made advances on her, to which Luukia replied:
“We cannot do such a thing, as I am defiled.” Upon receiving this reply from Luukia,
Waiauwia was puzzled to know the meaning of such a thing; he insisted that she grant
his request. At this determination on his part, Luukia told Waiauwia: “Don’t come
in unto me, for I have my period of infirmity. This is the reason why I am separated
from Olopana the king.”

<p>This was the first time that Waiauwia ever heard of such a thing, that men were prohibited

to return to Waimea, and there informed his wife that it was against the wish of the
gods to have men live with their wives during their periods of infirmity. Some time
after this first meeting between Waiauwia and Luukia at Puukawaiwai, Waiauwia again
visited Luukia at her house of separation, after one of her periods of infirmity,

<p class="first">Moikeha was the father and Hooipoikamalanai was the mother of Kila, whose birthplace
was the land of Kapaa. There were three children in the family, of which Kila was
the youngest. While very young it was their custom to resort to the Wailua River and
there learn the art of canoe sailing. In the wrestling matches Kila, though the youngest,
always prevailed over his older brothers. One day, in order to determine which one
of his sons was the strongest, bravest and most skillful in the art of canoe sailing,
Moikeha decided to give them a test. After calling his sons to come before him, he
said: “I want you all to go to the other side of the river and set your canoes down
in the water and let them sail toward me. The one who will be able to so steer his
canoe as to hit me in the navel will surely be the most prosperous amongst you.”
</p>
<p>After arriving at their stations the first-born set his canoe down and steered it
to his father, but it missed the mark. The second son then in his turn set his down
and steered it for the mark, but it missed also. Kila then in his turn started his,
and it sailed directly to Moikeha and hit his navel. Moikeha then addressed his sons,
saying: “You two,” turning to the oldest, “will never amount to much. This your youngest
brother will be the most prosperous of you all.”

<p>Moikeha originally came from Tahiti, through grief and depression of spirit over Luukia.
Because of his great grief he left his home Moaulanuiakea, the chiefs, the people
and the demi-gods of the deep. On his way to Kauai he met Kakakauhanui off the Kalaau
point, Molokai, fishing. This man had very long legs; his body while in the water
could steady his canoe with his legs. He could stay under water without breathing
for a very long time. Upon meeting this man, Moikeha took him as an adopted son and
brought him along to Kauai. Moikeha was a high chief, and his wife Hooipoikamalanai
was a chiefess of very high rank throughout the whole island of Kauai.

<p>After the lapse of some time, Moikeha fitted out a double canoe for his son Kila and
instructed him to go to Tahiti and slay his old enemies. After everything pertaining
to the voyage was ready, the paddlers, the bailers, immediate attendants, uncles and
Kakakauhanui boarded the canoe together with Kila, who sat in the covered platform,
and they set sail for Tahiti. Before Kila boarded the canoe, however, Moikeha addressed
him saying: “You are on your way. Don’t fail to recognize your uncle Makalii, or you
will kill him.” After all the islands had disappeared and all that could be seen was
the top of Maunakea, they were met by Keaumiki and Keauka,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7353src" href="#xd32e7353">1</a> two <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>monster demigods of the deep, who drew their canoe down to the coral beds of the sea:
so Kakakauhanui dove down to the bottom and <span class="corr" id="xd32e7358" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> there for ten<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7361src" href="#xd32e7361">2</a> and two nights before coming up again. Keaumiki and Keauka were only able to stay
down ten nights. This feat of endurance saved the canoe. The voyage was then resumed.
</p>
<p>When they were approaching near to Tahiti they first touched at a small island where
the aunt of Moikeha was living, a supernatural rat, Kanepohihi by name. Her eyes were
covered over with wrinkles and she was blind. When Kila came upon her she was cooking
bananas in the ashes. When he saw Kanepohihi cooking bananas, he reached down, took
the bananas and placed them on to one side of the cooking place. When Kanepohihi reached
for the bananas she was unable to find them, so she said to herself: “There must be
a demi-god about.”
</p>
<p>At this Kila addressed her saying: “My greetings to you, Kanepohihi.”

<p>Makalii was Moikeha’s own younger brother, and he was the king and ruler of the land.
He had a net named after himself, Makalii, in which were kept the food and fish as
well as other things. Makalii, who was also educated in all of the arts of the day,
could tell of coming future events, as well as Moikeha or Kila. Because of this power
as a fortune-teller he was able to foresee the arrival of Kila to his kingdom. So
he took up all the food and placed it in a net and hung it out of reach, which was
the origin of the old Hawaiian saying: “Makalii drew in his net (koko) and hung it
up.” Kanepohihi, on being requested for food, changed herself into the form of a rat
and climbed up, nibbled at the net of Makalii, cutting it and causing the food and
fish to fall out, thus supplying Kila and his companions with food.

<p>Shortly after this Kila sailed for the main island, the canoe going toward the kapued
harbor, where the kapu stick was standing. This place was Moikeha’s; no canoe was
allowed to land here; no person was allowed to pass by it upon pain of death. The
place had been kapued before Moikeha left, and ever since his departure its sacredness
had been maintained. When the canoe was nearing the landing place the people on shore
were heard calling: “There is a canoe! There is a canoe!! That canoe does not seem
to have any fear for the kapu of the king. Your superior strength, if any you have,
will be the only salvation for you this day.”
</p>
<p>Before Kila and his people reached the landing place and hauled their canoe up on
the sand, he was bundled up and placed on the platform. Kila, as we have said, was
a very handsome man and was good to look upon, so much so that it could not be hidden
by the covering in which he was wrapped. After he had been placed on the platform
he addressed his followers, saying: “When you see a large man come to the canoe, it
is Mua. He is a great admirer of women. He is the man that was the betrayer of Moikeha,
and the one that caused Moikeha to leave his own country. Don’t tell him about me,
in case he should ask you.”
</p>
<p>As soon as Mua reached the canoe, he looked over the men and stood them up. Examining
the first one and finding a protuberance on his body, he remarked: “You will never
be able to get Luukia.” He then examined the next man, and so on to the last, with
the exception of Kila. The reason why Mua examined the men was because he wished to
find one who could command the admiration of Luukia, and by him get a chance to approach
Luukia, as he had never been able to please Luukia even up to this time.

<p>At this time the place was packed with the chiefs and people who were eager to see
the conflict. They never had any idea that the small man had any chance with the big
man at all. Niniukalani, upon seeing Ukulii, began to twirl his war club, Kahikinaakala,
and, when Ukulii was within striking distance, let it come down; but Ukulii jumped
to the right and toward his opponent. The club missed its object and hit the sand,
causing it to fly in all directions, and left a deep valley, hiding the two contestants
from view for a time. Everybody believed that Ukulii was killed. After <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>the cloud of sand had settled, the people saw that both of the contestants were still
there. Ukulii then twirled his club and made a feint as though to strike. Niniukalani
dodged, but before he could recover himself, Ukulii struck to the right which caught
Niniukalani squarely, cutting him in two and killing him instantly. At this the crowd
cried out: “One for the stranger and none for the son of the soil. Nobly done! No
wonder this canoe dared to land on kapued ground, for it carries a noble warrior.”

<p>Ukulii, after his encounter, returned and boarded the canoe. When Pohinakahonua was
seen to come out and issue his challenge, Kila asked: “Which one of you will go and
meet Pohinakahonua?” Hohoiea answered: “I will.” Kila then instructed him what to
do, and he jumped ashore to meet Pohinakahonua. As soon as he was within reach Pohinakahonua
swung his club to the right, but Hohoiea was not there, as he had jumped to the left
of Pohinakahonua. Hohoiea then swung his club from the ground upward, which cut Pohinakahonua
in two from his hips to his head, killing him. At this the crowd gave another shout,
saying: “The strangers have two, and the sons of the soil have none. This canoe carries
some mighty men who have killed the warrior guards of the land.”
</p>
<p>The result of the conflict was then carried to the king, Makalii. When Makalii heard
it he arose and came down with his war club, Naulukohelewalewa. Makalii at this time
was living in a land above the clouds. Makalii was a goodly man to look upon, closely
resembling his older brother Moikeha. He was very powerful and brave, but not like
Kila. As Makalii arrived on the kapued ground he began to swing his war club right
and left. Upon seeing this Kila said to his men: “That is Makalii, the king. He is
a very powerful man; none of you will be able to stand up against him. I will go and
meet him. But before I go, I want you to remember this: if I shall be slain in this
encounter, you have your course of escape, return by it to Kauai; but in case I live,
then all will be well.” Kila then took up his war club, Kahihikolo,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7459src" href="#xd32e7459">6</a> and jumped ashore from the canoe, stepping on the rocks. At sight of Kila the crowd
began to shout, admiring his beauty. Even the ants were heard to sing in his praise;
the birds sang, the pebbles rumbled, the shells cried out, the grass withered, the
smoke hung low, the rainbow appeared, the thunder was heard, the dead came to life,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7462src" href="#xd32e7462">7</a> the hairless dogs were seen and countless spirits of all kinds were seen. All these
things mentioned were the people of Moikeha, who upon the arrival of Kila his son,
caused themselves to be seen, in testimony of Kila’s high chief rank.

<p>As Kila came within reach, Makalii brought down his war club, Naulukohelewalewa. The
wind whistled by, the dust and sand arose in clouds, and a deep valley <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>was seen where the club struck the ground. The two were hidden in the dust. The people
ashore thought that Kila was killed, but after the cloud of dust and sand had settled
they beheld Makalii and Kila still facing each other; because when Makalii swung his
club on the right he brought it down on his left, so Kila had jumped toward the right
side of Makalii and was saved from a terrible death. As they again faced each other,
Kila twirled and brought down his club, Kahikikolo, the swirl of which felled Makalii.
The reason of this escape was because Kila had in mind the warning given him by Moikeha
his father, upon his departure from Kauai, in the following words: “You are about
to go on your voyage. If you should fight with your uncle, don’t be thoughtless, else
you will kill him.” This was the only reason why Makalii was saved; otherwise he would
not have again seen the warming sun.

period of time sufficiently long to cook an oven (umu) of food; whereupon he arose

<p>The end of this contest saw Kila master of all the lands. The canoe was then beached
and he went ashore. At this the shells<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7476src" href="#xd32e7476">9</a> cried and asked: “What is the object of this voyage that has brought my lord here?”
Kila replied: “It is a voyage in search of a chief.” The shells said: “There are no
more chiefs; all are dead. We were deserted by your father in this place, without
food and without fish, your father taking everything with him, and we have managed
to just exist.”

<p>Kila then continued on his way, meeting the former inhabitants of the land who wailed
and cried to him, until he arrived at the palace of Moikeha, Moaulanuiakea. This was
a very beautiful house, being very lofty and was thatched over with the feathers of
birds. The battens were made from the bones of birds and the timbers were of kauila
wood. It is said in the legend of Moikeha that the reason why Moikeha journeyed to
Kauai and lived with Hooipoikamalanai was on account of his oath, never to return
after the ridge-pole of his house, Moaulanuiakea, had sunk out of sight.

<p>When Kila arrived at the house he looked it over and saw that it was indeed grand,
majestic and lofty; but there were no people; the doors were fastened; the guards
were dead and the place was overgrown with weeds. Kila, however, had with him the
means of unfastening the doors and of bringing the guards to life as well as everything
else. As he opened the gate, two of the guards came to life and wept over him. As
he entered the roadway to the house, two more of the guards came to life. Arriving
at the main door, two more guards came to life. As the door was opened another two
came to life, and entering the house he found a guard in each room who all came and
kneeled before him with tears in their eyes. Kila then lit the lamp which once belonged
to Moikeha, walked to the couch and laid down.

<p>While Kila was asleep Luukia came outside of the house, spying, watching this glow
inside, its redness; and when she saw this red glow, tears fell from her eyes. She
choked, and her heart quickened when she thought it was Moikeha. The night was far
spent when the guards fell asleep. Luukia walked softly and carefully to where Kila
was sleeping and looked at him; he resembled Moikeha, but was handsomer. She leaped
on him crying, and embraced and kissed him. Kila awoke startled and looked at her.

father went away to this day.” Kila then said: “If you will consent it can be unfastened,
and it can be closed again.” Luukia consented, and Kila unfastened [the cords]. Then
they gathered up the fine strands of thought, indulging in love’s desire, and braided
the lehua wreaths in dreamland, after which Luukia went her way. Later she became

<p>This story pertains to Umi, but in order to get at all the facts the story of Hakau
his older brother should also be considered. Liloa was the father and Piena was the
mother of Hakau; the father as well as the mother were chief and chiefess of very
high blood. It is said that Hakau was one of the highest chiefs of Hawaii because
both of his parents were of equally high blood. Waipio in Hawaii was the place where
Liloa had his permanent residence. Here he lived with his wife Piena, and it was at
this place that Hakau was born. Liloa was the king of the whole of Hawaii.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8129src" href="#xd32e8129">1</a>

<p>Some time after the birth of Hakau, the first son of Liloa by his wife Piena, Liloa
started out from Waipio and journeyed to Koholalele, a place at the east end of Hamakua,
close on to Hilo. The cause of this journey by Liloa was to dedicate a temple which
was at this place. The name of the temple was Manini. After the ceremonies pertaining
to the dedication of the temple were ended he journeyed over to Kaawikiwiki, where
he <span class="corr" id="xd32e8140" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> for some days. The cause of the delay at this place was the games that were being
held, for it was the place where people from all the neighboring districts gathered
to partake in the game of pahee<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8143src" href="#xd32e8143">2</a> especially, although other games were also held there. While at the place, he one
day went out to bathe in the Hoea stream, which is located next to Kealakaha. When
he arrived at the place he saw a very beautiful woman, Akahiakuleana, coming out of
the stream, without clothing. Her maid servant was sitting on the bank of the stream
with her mistress’s garment. When Liloa saw Akahiakuleana his desire to possess her
became so great that they laid together, resulting in the birth of Umi, the subject
of this story, for Akahiakuleana was just over her days of defilement, hence her quick
conception.

<p class="first">In course of due time it became apparent to all that Akahiakuleana was with child.
Her husband thought of course the child was his, so he took great care of his wife.
He did not know that it belonged to Liloa. When Akahiakuleana gave birth to the child,
she gave him the name of Umi, and brought him up carefully until he was well grown.
As he grew, Umi was very mischievous and would often go out to play with other boys.
It was his custom on going out to join the boys in their games to bring <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>them all to the house and then give them all the food in the house. When his mother’s
husband returned he would get angry and often punish the boy. This was continued for
many days, until at last the mother took pity on the boy and protested against the
harsh treatment of her son Umi.

replied: “Your father is in Waipio; his name is Liloa.” Umi then said: “Shall I not
go and see my father?” The mother replied: “Yes, you may go.” Some time after this
Akahiakuleana’s husband again beat Umi, when she said to her husband: “My husband,
the child is not yours that you should beat him.” The husband in angry voice then
asked: “And whose child is it, Liloa’s?” The wife replied: “Yes, it is Liloa’s child,

Akahiakuleana then called for her maid servant to bring the things for Umi that were
left by Liloa. On the things being brought in the wife said: “Here are the proofs.”

given him, although a large one, was taken from under the seat of the paddlers. When
Umi saw this he took the fish, but again exchanged it with one of the other paddlers
for one that he saw was taken from the middle of the canoe and not from under the
seat like the one he had. In asking for the exchange Umi said to the man: “Here, take
my aku in exchange for your’s; mine is a larger fish.” The man consented to this and
the exchange was made. Umi did not, however, take the fish home to be eaten, but took
it and gave it as an offering to his god, Kaili,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8364src" href="#xd32e8364">10</a> which was hidden in a crevice in the cliff at Hokuli, in a place which no one but
himself knew. Umi after this went out very often to fish for aku, and every time he
was given his share he would take some and offer it to Kaili his god at its hiding
place.

<p>At about this time people began to see and to wonder at the frequent appearance of
a rainbow on the cliff. Kaoleioku, a high priest who was living at this place, also
saw the rainbow, and he, too, wondered at its constant appearance; but being of a
class well versed in ancient lore, he began a study of the matter and concluded that
it must be Umi, for rumors of his disappearance had come to them shortly before this.
In order to make sure that his findings were true he decided to test the matter, and
so one day he took up a pig and came down to look for Umi. When he entered the house
and saw the form of Umi, and how noble and chiefly he looked, he made up his mind
that it was indeed Umi. He, however, took the pig and offered it to Umi with a prayer,
saying: “Here is the pig, O god, a chief-searching pig.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8372src" href="#xd32e8372">11</a> At the close of his prayer he released the pig and it walked towards Umi. After standing
in the presence of Umi for a short time it turned and came back to Kaoleioku. Kaoleioku
then asked: “Are you indeed Umi?” “Yes,” said Umi, “it is I.” Kaoleioku then said:
“Let us return to my house.” Umi assented and they returned to the home of Kaoleioku.
When the father-in-law and mother-in-law as well as the people around the place saw
this, they then knew that this young man was the chief Umi, the son of Liloa, the
one that they had heard was lost.

<p class="first">These were old men who had served under Liloa as priests and were great favorites
of his. After the death of Liloa they again served under Hakau, his son, when he became
the king of Hawaii. But shortly after Hakau assumed the reins of power the old men
fell sick and they took some cathartic medicine. After the effects of the medicine
had disappeared and a longing for food came upon them, they sent a servant to go to
Hakau and get some food, meat and awa. Upon the arrival of the messenger in the presence
of Hakau, Hakau asked the man: “What are you after?” He replied: “I have been sent
by the old men to come to you, the king, and ask you for some food, meat and awa for
them, for they have been taking some medicine and are now craving for some food.”
When Hakau heard the words of the messenger, he said: “Go back and tell them that
there is no food, no meat and no awa.”
</p>
<p>In the days of Liloa, Nunu and Kakohe were great favorites, for they were the custodians
of the great god Kaili, and whatever they wanted was always granted them by Liloa.
The influence of these two old men was so great that even Liloa could in no way enter
into any conflict without their consent and advice; and Liloa was constrained from
doing anything without their knowledge. These old men were consequently Liloa’s favorites,
and after the death of Liloa they continued exercising the same influence over Hakau.

where the awa container was kept and brought it and placed it by his side; he then

over to the umu and uncovered an umu that was alongside of the one he had just covered,
which contained a pig well cooked, which he took out and brought to the eating place,

where all the men were engaged in cultivating food. When Umi arrived, Kaoleioku said
to him: “Have the old men arrived?” Umi replied: “Yes, they have arrived, and I have
carried out your orders and have prepared everything for their comfort. They are both
overcome with awa, and when I left they were sound asleep.” When Kaoleioku heard this
report from Umi he said to him: “Let us remain with your men, and in the afternoon
we will return. The order of our return shall be as follows: I will go on down ahead,
the men will then come after me, while you come on behind the procession.” This was
agreeable to Umi. The reason why Kaoleioku arranged the procession in this order was
to allow him a chance to meet the old men first and thus give him time to answer any
questions that they may put to him relating to Umi, for he wished to make a very favorable
report of his ward, and also to keep the old men from making a mistake in their choice

by Omaokamau, for Umi.” When the people heard this remark by Omaokamau, they began
to throw their stones on Hakau, killing him. The stones caused a great heap above
Hakau, while the sticks <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>which had been used as packers for the burdens carried on the shoulders, formed the
cone-shaped tomb of Hakau.

the whole of Hawaii. After the death of Hakau the people who had been sent up to the
mountain returned with their sticks. When they arrived they saw Umi with his men in
possession of everything. They then knew that their king Hakau must be dead, so they
wept for him; but those who did this were but few, for Hakau in his day was ever a
cruel king, one who killed his men without cause.

<p>It is said that when Hakau was king he used to do the following things: Whenever a
man was praised for his good looks, or a woman for beauty, he would cause the death
of that person. If the head of a person was praised for being flat,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8532src" href="#xd32e8532">23</a> the head would be cut off; and if the body was praised, then the body was cut up;
if the eyes were praised they would be gouged out, and so on. Once upon a time one
of the priests of Hakau, upon seeing a young boy, said to his parents: “This child
has a very fine body; he has not a single blemish.” When Hakau heard this remark,
he immediately sent a messenger to bring the boy to his presence. When the boy arrived
Hakau then cut the boy in two. When the parents heard that Hakau had cruelly killed
their child, the father made a prophecy, saying: “He has cut my son;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8535src" href="#xd32e8535">24</a> his kingdom shall also be cut from him. This shall happen on the day to be declared
kapued for his god. He will die on that day.” This prophecy was, therefore, fulfilled.

purpose except that of making tests, such as this, where the priest wished to determine
the length of time a king was to reign. Kaoleioku then said to Omaokamau: “Say, Omaokamau,
use all your strength and throw the spear at the king’s middle.” Kaoleioku was well
aware that Omaokamau was a great spearsman, being of great strength. At this order,
Omaokamau raised the spear, poised it and then threw it at Umi with all his might.
[The thrust was known as “wahie.”] As the point of the spear came near Umi’s middle,
Umi warded it off causing the spear to go glancing to his rear; while the spear was
still on its flight Umi caught it by the point and held it.

Kaoleioku said: “I will predict to you what the gods have told me in the matter of

<p>When Umi said this, the old man was greatly frightened, but he stood up and started
off running, following the order of the king. After Nunu had started, Omaokamau followed
him to see how much ground he would cover, wondering what the king was about. In running
the old man’s feet became entangled soon after he started and he fell down, but he
got up and kept on running; but he tripped on his feet and again fell, face down,
breathing very heavily. When Umi and the other old man, Kakohe, came up to where he
was lying face downward, Umi said to him: “Say, are you exhausted?” All Nunu could
say was “Hu.” After waiting for a while Nunu recovered himself, and so Umi said to
him: “From the point where you started to this place where we are standing, covering
two ahupuaas, is the width of your land.” In making this remark to Nunu, Kakohe heard
it, so he said to himself: “So, that is the way the king is going to give lands to
his people. They must run until they fall down. He is indeed justified in doing this,
for we must bear our burden even as he did when we made him work for us.” Umi then
turned to Kakohe and said: “Now <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>you must run.” Kakohe then started off and Piimaiwaa accompanied him. They ran until
one ahupuaa was passed, when Kakohe fell down to the ground and he remained there
exhausted. When Umi arrived at the place where Kakohe was lying, he said: “Exhausted,
are you?” Kakohe said “Hu.” This expression, “hu”, was intended to be for “u”, meaning
“yes”, but being so exhausted, the “u” was changed into “hu”. Umi then said to Kakohe:
“This is your land, one ahupuaa, while Nunu has two ahupuaas. You two will make your
own arrangements in reference to their use.” Turning to both the old men, Umi continued:
“All of the things that are growing on your lands are yours, and you two shall do
what you wish with your lands without any reference to me; and you can leave the same
to your heirs after you.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8604src" href="#xd32e8604">28</a> At the close of these remarks to the old men they all returned to the Waipio Valley

toward the east first, this being your first journey around your kingdom. If you were

<p>While Umi was living in humble circumstances in Waipunalei, Hilo, he and Koi one day
went down to the beach at Laupahoehoe, the great bathing place in those days, where
they saw Paiea and several people of the place out surf riding. While looking on they
often heard praises of Paiea and his great skill in the use of the surf board. Umi
approached one of the people of the place and whispered to him: “Is that the best
Paiea can do, just to rise up with the surf and fall back again? That is not the way
surf is ridden in our land. One must ride clear to the edge of the beach before he
can be called an expert.” When the fellow heard this he went over to Paiea and repeated
to him what he had heard. Upon hearing this expression of criticism against his skill
as a surf rider, he called Umi to come to him. When Umi came up to Paiea, he was asked:
“Is it true that you passed the remark that has been reported to me by this man?”
Umi replied: “It was only a casual remark on my part; I did not think that he would
take it seriously.” Paiea then said to Umi: “Let us have a race surf riding. If you
beat me I will be your servant, and if I beat you, you will be mine.” Umi accepted
the challenge and wager. Not satisfied with this wager, Paiea further put up two double
canoes and one single canoe against Umi’s whale’s tooth necklace. Again Paiea offered
four double canoes thinking to wager them against the bones of Umi,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8626src" href="#xd32e8626">29</a> but a young man belonging to Laupahoehoe stepped in and helped Umi by matching four
double canoes against the four offered by Paiea. This young man was very wealthy,
but Paiea’s stock of wealth was already exhausted. Because of this assistance to Umi
by the young man, Paiea said to him: “If your intention was to conspire against me
I would have been killed, for you have very many relatives.” Paiea was but a petty
chief under Liloa, while the young man was a high chief, a resident descendant of
the soil of Hilo and Hamakua.

<p>After the bets had been decided on, Umi and Paiea swam out to the point where the
surf rose before breaking and there floated waiting for a surf to form. After they
were in position, Paiea upon seeing the first surf called out to Umi: “Let us take
this one.” But Umi said, “No”. On the approach of the second surf, Paiea again called
out to Umi: “Let us take this one.” Again Umi refused to take it. On the approach
of the third surf, Umi called out: “Let us take this one.” “Yes,” said Paiea and they
then caught the surf at the same time and away they came in on the same surf. As they
neared a rock that was in their way, Umi was crowded by Paiea against this rock. When
Umi saw his predicament he made a turn, passing the coral rock on the inside, and
rode clear to the edge of the beach, beating Paiea. As Umi stepped on to the beach,
Koi saw the bruise on the shoulder of Umi, so he went up to him and whispered: “After

what to do. Therefore they went and inquired of Omaokamau: “What is the object of
the call of your canoe?” Omaokamau replied: “It is on a journey of sightseeing.” Omaokamau
then in turn asked the people: “Where is the king and queen?” “They are at home.”
Omaokamau then proceeded to the king’s house. When Piilani saw him, he said: “You
make a quick passage.” Omaokamau greeted those present, and the people greeted him

<p>At the end of twenty days Piikea set sail for Hawaii to meet Umi. She was accompanied
by a fleet of canoes amounting to about four hundred. While the canoes were still
out in the channel of Alenuihaha,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8676src" href="#xd32e8676">30</a> the red insignia of the canoe bearing the young princess was plainly seen from Waipio,
and by this sign the people knew that it was the young princess Piikea of Maui. As
Piikea was about to touch the Waipio beach the heaven was covered over by thick rain
clouds, and a rainbow formed standing from in front of the canoe of the princess to
its rear and remained standing proudly like a <span class="corr" id="xd32e8679" title="Source: hugh">huge</span> helmet. As soon as the canoe bearing Piikea was beached Omaokamau stepped up to it
and lifted Piikea out and placed her on the shoulders of Piimaiwaa, who carried her
into the presence of Umi the king. Umi then greeted Piikea, and she greeted Umi in
return.

<p>The love borne by the two toward each other was mutual and they lived as husband and
wife in peace and happiness.

<p>Some little time after the two had been united, tidings were brought of the death
of Piilani, the father of Piikea, and king of Maui.

“Those things are plentiful and common with the children of our place, and owned by

<p class="first">When Umi-a-Liloa broke the tongue of the wiliwili necklace of the daughter of Kulukulua,
after she fully realized that it was destroyed she wept bitterly and ran over to her
father, saying: “My necklace ornament is completely broken by my husband.” The father
then said: “What was the reason for destroying your necklace?” The daughter replied:
“The man said that he was ashamed of it; the wiliwili necklace ornament was common
among their people from children to old women, and that the royal necklace of their
chiefs were the teeth of the whale forming the ivory ornament.” Kulukulua then said
to his daughter: “Those men should be securely bound with cords, and if the ivory
royal necklace is not furnished, then they shall all be slain and sacrificed at the
temple of Kanoa.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8762src" href="#xd32e8762">39</a> Therefore, Kulukulua commanded his men, and Umi-a-Liloa, Omaokamau and Koi were securely
bound, while Piimaiwaa was allowed to go to Waipio to bring the ivory necklace, because
a command had been given that the ivory ornament must be produced within one day,
and if it was not furnished in one day they would all be killed. So Piimaiwaa hurried
down to Waipio and in a short time apprised the chiefs there of the predicament which
befell Umi and his companions at Hilo. Without waste of time Piimaiwaa returned the
same day and placed the ivory ornament in the hand of the daughter of Kulukulua. She
was made very happy on seeing this uncommon thing that the tooth of a whale was made
into an ivory royal necklace. She hopped around with joyful laughter at her good fortune,
but to Umi-a-Liloa it was a sad occasion to lose the royal necklace inheritance of
his royal father Liloa; but he earnestly prayed to his god Kukailimoku that the royal
necklace of Nanikoki be safeguarded with the chiefs of Hilo until the time they [the
chiefs of Hilo] would be conquered.

fact. He thought that there was war in the mountains which was the cause of the dirt
in the stream. Others contradicted: there was no war; the dirt in the water was the
result of a cloudburst causing the muddy stream which flowed down to the sea. But
in this the man would not agree with them; he held to the idea that the discoloration
of the water was caused by the feet of men. He hurriedly pulled his net into his canoe
and returned to the shore. He did not wait to dry his net, but seized a long spear,

immediately set out toward the mountain. Nau was the name of the man.

<p>This continued for some time and many men were killed by this one man because of the
narrowness of the trail, and of its nearness to Kauamoa. Forty men were thus killed.
Piimaiwaa, therefore, went to the top of the cliff and on looking down he saw only
one man, hugging close to the bank. Then Piimaiwaa muttered to himself: “I’ll kill
you;” whereupon he leaped down the cliff and caused his [Nau’s] death. When Nau was
killed there was no one to warn the chiefs of Hilo, and when night came the fighting
was being carried down to Hilo. Umi’s army were provided with torches, and Umi-a-Liloa
knew the king’s house in Hilo as also that of the daughter of Kulukulua; these were
surrounded by Umi’s men, the chiefs of Hilo killed, the daughter of Kulukulua preserved,
and the famous royal ivory necklace of Nanikoki recovered. As the cause of the war
was the much desired ivory necklace, at the end of the conflict Hilo and Hamakua became
united, with Umi as king.

<p>Imaikalani was the king of Kau. He was blind and was famous for his strength and skill
in warfare, whereby several chiefs were killed by him in battle. He had a left thrust
and a right thrust which were terrible, and if he threw a long spear to the right
or to the left hand there was a roaring as of thunder, and flashes as of lightning,
and a rumbling sound as of an earthquake; and if he twirled his spear at his back
the dust arose in volumes as whirlwinds. Umi-a-Liloa was afraid of Imaikalani, who
was a blind man and could not at all see with his eyes, but his hearing was acute.
He had two wild duck watchers which reported to him the appearance of any one either
from the front or from the rear, or from the sides, whichever way the voices of the
birds indicated. In former times, when Imaikalani was not blind and Kau was not in
the possession of Umi, there was war for a long time. Umi therefore went into the
mountains and made secret raids on Imaikalani, and on the chiefs of Kona, so that
he became famous as the mountain rover of Hawaii, and the mountains were familiar
to him for the waging of wars. But when Imaikalani became blind they were constantly
at war with each other. Imaikalani was never in subjection to Umi.

<p>Piimaiwaa sought in various ways to learn the source of Imaikalani’s great strength,
and the skill with which he threw the long spear with such unerring aim, and the stroke
of his war club that would rip one open from head to buttocks. Piimaiwaa discovered
the source of Imaikalani’s skill and the daring bravery of this blind man to be by
means of the wild ducks hovering above, for when the birds made a noise and the blind
man heard it, either in front, or behind, or on the sides, then he (the blind man)
would say: “There is a man behind.” The men leading him on both sides said: “Yes,
there is a man.” “Where does he hold his club?” “In front.” It was plain that it was
a war club. “Is he near?” “Yes.” The blind man suddenly threw his own club which cleaved
the man from head to buttocks. When the man appeared the birds warned. “Where is his
club?” “It is on the right-hand side.” “It is a left thrust then that will strike
him.” When the man made a strike it missed, but the thrust made by the blind man took
effect from the head to the waist.

“I will kill you.” First he went and destroyed the scout birds; then the attendants

the weapons, there were forty in number, ever ready with spears and lances, because
Imaikalani usually threw ten spears at a single throw, five from the right and five

<p>Another thing that Umi-a-Liloa was famous for was his battle with the gods. The cause
of this battle was in this way: His royal consort, Piikea, had supernatural grandmothers,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8836src" href="#xd32e8836">43</a> who were Hapuu and Kalaihauola, and who desired to have a grandchild that they might
take it to Oahu to bring up, because the mother of Piikea, Laieloheloheikawai, belonged
to Oahu. It was Laieloheloheikawai who sent the supernatural grandmothers to Hawaii
to obtain one of Piikea’s children. When they arrived in Hawaii Umi-a-Liloa refused
to permit a child to be taken to Oahu to her (Piikea’s) mother. He had already made
a vow that none of his children with Piikea would be given to any one, and on that
account the supernatural personages murdered people during the night, for in the morning
the dead people were found. This continued every night, the people dying without cause.
Umi-a-Liloa was therefore astonished at the way the men were killed without any knowledge
of the murderers.

Kailua. On account of this heavy tribute required by Hawaii the attendant of Aihakoko
was killed by Kihapiilani, and for that reason Aihakoko went mourning out in the ocean
and landed in Kapaahu, Kamaole, in Kula, whereby the place derived its name of Kalua-o-Aihakoko.
The stone tomb of Umi-a-Liloa was not completed when he died at Kailua, Hawaii.

here they again set sail and landed in Kekaha at night. In this place was a man who
resembled Umi-a-Liloa, whom Koi went and killed and placed in the canoe. From Kekaha,
Koi and his companions proceeded and landed on the rocks below Makaeo. It was about
midnight when Koi went up and found the guards of the sepulchre asleep. Piimaiwaa
was the inner guard, and here was Koi coming in with a substitute body. Piimaiwaa
had heard that the corpse of Umi had already been given to Koi. The substitute corpse
was placed in position and the body of Umi-a-Liloa was taken out by Koi, and carried
over the rocks toward the sea to Makaeo and placed in the canoe. From this night to
the next night they traveled till they arrived at the precipitous cliffs of Waimanu,
where Koi entered the home of his sister, who, on seeing her brother, ran forward
weeping loudly.

disregarded the words of their father.

<p>When Piilani came to the throne of all Maui he made his residence at Kauiki in Hana,
and there he took his brother to live with him. While living together Piilani did
not care for his brother according to the instructions of their father before his
death. It was customary with Piilani while eating, or sitting in company, to care
more for the others than his brother Kihapiilani. Every time his brother was around
he would show a marked degree of hatred towards him, and he evinced his displeasure
in many ways.

<p>One day while Piilani was eating with his companions, all strangers, enjoying the
good things placed before them, Kihapiilani, although present at the table, was not
served with any of the good things; but, in front of him was placed a small calabash
containing some small fish. This dish belonged to Piilani. Seeing that this was all
there was to be had within reach, he reached into the dish and took out two small
fish and ate them. While doing this he was seen by Piilani. Piilani then reached for
the dish and held it up in his hand, then asked of Kihapiilani: “Who ate of the fish
in this dish?” Kihapiilani replied: “I did, because there was nothing else for me
to eat.” Piilani then threw the dish with the fish in it, brine and all, at the forehead
of his brother, breaking the dish into pieces and spattering the fish and brine into
the eyes of Kihapiilani which blinded him for a while.

<p>Because of this ill treatment by his elder brother, showing no love or respect for
him, Kihapiilani got up and secretly ran away to Kalaniwai, a place in Makawao. While
there he met a woman belonging to the place and they were united and lived as husband
and wife. The people of the place, however, did not know that this was Kihapiilani,
the chief, but took him to be a man from the country. While living with his wife’s
parents he was often spoken of as a lazy fellow, spending his time sleeping instead
of going out to work. When Kihapiilani heard his wife’s parents speak of him <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>as being a lazy fellow, he got up and went down to get potato stalks in the lowlands
of Kaluaama at Haiku. Upon his arrival at this place, an old man by the name of Kukuiokaaulani
saw him and recognized him as of high rank; so he said to his companion, another old
man: “Say, that man that is coming down is either a chief or a priest.” After a while
he again remarked: “It must be a chief. If there was but one rainbow, then it would
be a priest;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9486src" href="#xd32e9486">2</a> but since there are two it must surely be a chief.” The two finally decided that
the person was a chief, for the fact of the disappearance of Kihapiilani was well
known. The two old men then waited for the approach of the stranger. As soon as he
came up to them they greeted him, saying: “Our salutation to the chief.” Kihapiilani
then admonished them, saying: “Be quiet. Since you two have recognized me you must
not reveal my identity.”

<p>After this Kihapiilani continued on his way until he came to Kaluaama, where a large
patch of sweet potatoes was growing. Kihapiilani then proceeded to pick a quantity
of stalks, taking and breaking them from the vines, leaving the hills bare. While
he was thus busily picking stalks the owner of the patch arrived, and upon seeing
what Kihapiilani was doing he came up to him and began beating him with a stick, but
Kihapiilani paid no attention to his beating but kept on picking stalks. After he
had picked a quantity sufficient for his purpose he tied them into a large pack, placed
the pack on to his back and started for the uplands of Kalaniwai.

“What is the object of the chief’s journey to these parts?” Kihapiilani replied: “I
am seeking for someone to kill my brother Piilani. That is the object of my search.”
Kihapiilani then related the incident of the insult which caused Kihapiilani to seek

you will find our sister, Pao by name. Upon your arrival at the place she will direct
you what to do next, then you will gain your object and your older brother will be

</p>
<p>At the close of the conversation between the old men and Kihapiilani, he continued
on his way to the uplands of Kalaniwai, where he began planting his potato stalks.
For some time Kihapiilani devoted his whole time to the cultivation of his fields,
until his season of want was finally passed, for he felt bitterly the shame and insult
shown him by his wife’s parents when he was called a lazy fellow. When the potatoes
were at last matured he turned them over to his wife and her parents.

<p>After Kihapiilani had spoken to his wife relative to the field of potatoes, he said
to her: “My wife, I am going away and shall leave you. I have labored patiently in
the cultivation and care of these fields until they are ripened. You will eat the
fruit of our labor.” The wife replied: “Are you going away for good, then, and are
you not coming back again?” The husband replied: “Yes, I am not coming back for <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>a summer and a winter. If you have husband-regard, remain husbandless until my return.”
When the wife heard this she held Kihapiilani back and refused to allow him to go.
Because of this <span class="corr" id="xd32e9771" title="Source: stubborness">stubbornness</span> on his wife’s part he told her everything concerning himself in order to overcome
her opposition, so he said: “My wife, I am now going to reveal certain things to you
which you must not repeat, and I also urge upon you not to reveal my name. I am Kihapiilani;
I am going in search of some one who will kill my brother Lonoapii (Piilani).” When
the wife heard this she then knew that her husband was Kihapiilani, the great chief;
and she also knew that it was beyond her to withhold him from going, so she consented
for him to go on his way.

<p>When the man of learning heard the words of Kihapiilani, he ordered his canoe men
to prepare the canoe for a trip to Hawaii. When the preparation was complete, Kihapiilani
boarded the canoe and they set sail for Hawaii, to meet his sister Piikea and his
brother-in-law Umi. That same evening they landed at Waipio. As soon as they landed,
Kihapiilani proceeded to the house where Piikea was living and entered it. When his
sister saw him, she sprang on him and wept. At the end of their weeping Piikea asked:
“How are you getting along with your brother?” Kihapiilani answered his sister, saying:
“We do not get along at all; my brother ill-treats me; he gets angry, abuses me, and
has no love for me. That is why I have come to you, to tell you of these things.”
When Piikea heard this, she cried in a loud voice, recounting their life in their
early days while living with their parents and of their childhood wanderings here
and there, carefree and happy. While Piikea was wailing, Umi, who was in another house,
heard it and he wondered why his wife was crying; but after a while he was told that
it was because his brother-in-law, Kihapiilani had arrived. Soon after <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>this Piikea came out of her house, still crying in a loud voice, and began disrobing
and acting the part of one bereft of her mind. In doing this, Piikea was but acting
her part; she had her senses about her all right enough, but she did this to impress
on her husband Umi that a very great wrong had been committed, to rouse him to action.

<p>At the end of the wailing, Umi came up to her and asked her: “What is it that has
made you cry out so loud and why have you disrobed yourself?” Piikea answered: “Because
of the great love I bear my brother; this is the first time that we have met after
such a long separation; and also because I am grieved at the ill-treatment given him
by his brother Piilani. Because of this treatment I became so worked up that I wanted
to show my great grief. We must therefore go and make war on Piilani.” When Umi heard
this, he said: “I don’t think it proper for us to go and make war on Piilani, because
he is your own brother; he is not connected to you from a distance, a mere relative.”
Piikea said: “If you will not give your consent to my request, to go and make war
on Piilani, then it would be far better for me to die than to live.” At this, Umi
decided that he must obey his wife’s demand and so he gave his consent. Umi then summoned
his war counselors, Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa and Koi, and gave them orders to prepare
the fleet of war canoes for a trip to Maui to make war on Piilani.

of the kingdom, and that Piikea and Kihapiilani be the parents,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9820src" href="#xd32e9820">37</a> but Piikea stubbornly refused to have anything of the kind; she wanted to make war

<p class="first">Omaokamau was the first of Umi’s men who attempted to climb the Kauiki hill. When
he came up to the place where the ladder could be seen he saw that a three-cornered
rock was fastened at its top. When let go the rock would roll directly down, which
would kill the person attempting to go up the ladder. Therefore Omaokamau became afraid
and gave up the idea of climbing the ladder, so he thought deeply of a plan to accomplish
this, but without success. After thinking for some time he decided that a night attempt
to ascend the hill would be the best. When it became quite dark Omaokamau rose and
went up to the point where he could distinctly see the ladder; when he arrived at
the place he looked and saw a very large man, very tall, about eight feet, holding
a long, large war club in his hand. The war club was longer and larger than the war
club carried by himself. He also saw that the man had a loin <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>cloth girded around his waist and drawn very tight. The distance between Omaokamau
and the man was about 240 feet. When Omaokamau saw the man and the size of his war
club fear and doubt entered his breast; he believed that if he was hit by that war
club he would be knocked to pieces, so he was afraid to venture any further and decided
to return.

<p>That night when it became quite dark Piimaiwaa again climbed the hill to watch for
the large man as was reported, without the least bit of fear, and with a determination
to fight him to the end. When he reached the place where Omaokamau and Koi had stood
he looked up and sure enough there was the large man, very tall, very large, and his
club was the longest he had ever seen. When Piimaiwaa saw the man he began to study
out a course of action for him to follow, and finally he decided to do this: that
he would challenge the man to battle by the twirling of his war club, Wahie. This
way of challenging was usually used, and the acceptance of the challenge was shown
by the opponent by a return twirling of the war club. Piimaiwaa reasoned that in case
the man should see him and strike at him he would be far enough away not to be touched
by the club. Piimaiwaa then stepped up the ladder with firm feet, twirling his club
all the while. After twirling his club on his right for some time he changed and twirled
it on the left. After twirling the club on the left for some time, he looked at the
man for some time studying what the man was going to do. Failing in seeing the man
make any motion, he repeated the sign of the challenge, and still the man failed to
make any motion. Piimaiwaa therefore concluded that the man knew nothing of <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>the use of the war club, and that he was just holding it to strike at Piimaiwaa when
he got near enough, and that the man was not taught to ward off the blow with the
use of the club. When he saw this he said to himself: “If that is the case I shall
kill you immediately.”

<p>Piimaiwaa then advanced without fear until he reached the end of the man’s club. From
this point he advanced further until he reached the middle of the club, then on until
he reached the very man. Piimaiwaa then stood and prepared his club to poke at the
man. He then tapped the man, a sign to give the man warning; when he did he heard
a sound as of wood. He then approached the man and saw that it was only an image,
and not a real man. This ended his excitement and fear. He then took the wooden image
and threw it down, and rolled it over the cliff of Kapueokahi. Piimaiwaa then called
to those below: “Say, you people there down below, here is the image that we have
all this time taken for a real man. There is no fighting up here; the men are all
asleep; the hill is captured.”

<p>When Omaokamau and Koi heard the voice of Piimaiwaa calling from the top of the hill,
they came and followed him up. Before they arrived on the top of the hill, however,
Piimaiwaa had already begun the slaughter of the people and chiefs, and they joined
therein. The king of Maui was already dead, and this fact gave Umi the control of
the hill of Kauiki. This ended the battle, and Umi became possessed of the island
of Maui, which he turned over to Kihapiilani and returned with Piikea his wife, and
all his men, to Hawaii.

<p>When Lonoikamakahiki was quite young, when he was just about beginning to reason for
himself, he looked up one day and saw the various implements used by his father in
the different games, which were hanging up in the palace; when he saw the long spear
used in the game of pahee<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10152src" href="#xd32e10152">3</a> he looked at it for a long time and then asked his retainers: “What are those long
things hanging up there on the side of the house?” The retainers replied: “They are
pahee spears.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked them: “What are they used for?” The retainers
then told him: “When two men wish to wager certain articles of value, they would proceed
to the pahee grounds and upon arriving at the place they would decide first as to
the wager, whether it be articles of value or pieces of land. If they do not wager
these things, then they would put up other things, such as their bones, meaning their
lives. After the bets are agreed on, they would then proceed to play the game of pahee.
If the points to be scored in order to win the game be made fifteen, then the one
who first obtains this number of points would win and the one with the lesser points
would lose; then the winner takes the articles wagered, or whatever had been placed
as wagers. Sometimes the articles of value would be so great that it would take three

of course would be meted out to the loser. Wagering for bones was not made very often,
only when the parties entered into the merits of their skill by long and spirited
arguments, each claiming to be superior to the other. That is the use of those long
things you see.”

bundle of spears and the sling, for they are of value.” Keawenuiaumi then said to
the boy: “That is not what I think about those things. When the time comes for you

that ghosts were things to be avoided and feared, and he thought the images were the
ghosts. Because Lonoikamakahiki held on to his parents they said to him: “You must
not be afraid; what you see are not ghosts; they are the gods who own this place.”
Lonoikamakahiki then asked of his parents: “What are they good for?” The parents made
reply: “The reason why they are kept is this: If in case of battle one is taken captive
or defeated, they offer a prayer to the gods, and then the gods will direct the person
to safety. If, on the other hand, a canoe is capsized out in mid-ocean, prayers are
offered to the gods and those in the canoe will be saved. If a season of famine should
come, prayers are offered to the gods and the food would again appear out of the earth.
These are some of the benefits why a god should be kept.” Lonoikamakahiki then said

one exception, that of boxing, which, not being favorable in this one thing, he was

<p>When Lonoikamakahiki saw the old man he was greatly surprised, because this man was
the only man that differed from the rest of the men that came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi;
his hair was so long that it reached below his waist, a thing common with the high
priests, however. When Lonoikamakahiki, who was sitting with his attendants, had looked
at the old man for some time he asked: “Is that old man with the long hair a god?”
The attendants replied: “He is not a god; he is a human being, but not of the ordinary
kind; he is a counselor. He is also the high priest, higher than all the others.”
Again Lonoikamakahiki asked: “What is the old man good for?” The attendants replied:
“The man who is a counselor is a very great man in the court of the king; he must
be a man who is skilful in language, and whatever advice he gives the king, the king
will take heed. He can predict the coming of prosperity to the land and the people.
That man can tell whether a common person will become rich or poor, or the chief who
will become wealthy or not.”

<p>When Lonoikamakahiki heard these remarks from one of his retainers he was greatly
impressed that such a thing could be possible, that is, that the man could tell whether
a chief will become rich or poor. He therefore asked of his attendants: “And will
that old man be able to recognize me?” The attendants: “Yes, he will not overlook
you<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10239src" href="#xd32e10239">12</a> and also your doings in the future.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked them: “Is there
any restriction placed on that man, that is, something that will prevent young people
from addressing him? And are the grown up people the only ones that are allowed to
speak to him?” The attendants replied: “You are indeed privileged to address that
old man. Counselors and priests are retained and cared for to be used by the chiefs.”

Lonoikamakahiki spoke up saying: “You have been requested to come here because I have
been told that you are an old man who is learned in the things of the future and can
tell whether a chief will become rich or poor; therefore I want you to make an examination
of me and tell me what I am to be in the future.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>Kawaamaukele then replied: “You are going to be a wealthy chief at times, but when
you reach maturity then you will become poor, in that you will be without followers;
but you are going to be a brave chief.” Lonoikamakahiki then again asked him: “What
profession shall I take up in order that I may become wealthy? If you know what I
can take up that will be profitable as a profession, then we will take it up and you
instruct me in its detail.” The priest paused for a while, thinking of what Lonoikamakahiki
had asked, and then replied: “The professions that will make you famous all over the
islands are that of a counselor and hoopapa.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10246src" href="#xd32e10246">13</a> If you can be an expert in this profession of hoopapa, then you will become wealthy.”

<p>After Kaikilani had assumed the care of the government, Lonoikamakahiki made a circuit
of the island of Hawaii making public competitions in all the different arts of warfare
mastered by him, in which he was always victorious. Word of these accomplishments
of Lonoikamakahiki was in time carried to the hearing of Kanaloakuaana. When Lonoikamakahiki
arrived home after making this circuit, he competed in boxing against Kanaloakuaana,
for he, too, was skilful in all the arts of warfare. Kanaloakuaana did not demand
this competition for any other purpose than to test for himself how proficient Lonoikamakahiki
was, therefore they tried at boxing and Kanaloakuaana found that he was skilful. Kanaloakuaana
then took up spear throwing as the next thing. At this Lonoikamakahiki said: “I have
not studied the art of spear throwing; but what I have mastered is the art of dodging
the spear.” Kanaloakuaana therefore took him at his word and did the throwing while
Lonoikamakahiki did the dodging. In this trial Kanaloakuaana was satisfied that Lonoikamakahiki

subjects with which to carry on in the game of hoopapa. After having won Ohaikawiliula

in Kauai?” Ohaikawiliula answered: “There is a <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>chant, but it is one relating to myself.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10358src" href="#xd32e10358">20</a> Lonoikamakahiki again asked: “Is it a new chant?” Ohaikawiliula again replied: “Yes,

her: “What is the title of the chant?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “The Mirage of Mana.”

the loin cloth can be given up.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “You go back and get my
loin cloth and bring it here, and if they should ask you about the chant, then ask
them the title of the king’s chant.”

Loli then went back into the house, the palace of Kakuhihewa, Kamoa by name. Again
Loli took up the calabash and began to uncover it for the loin cloth and kapa of his
king. At this Kakuhihewa again asked: “Say, Loli, why are you again uncovering the
calabash belonging to your ward?” Loli made reply: “It is for the king’s loin cloth.”
Kakuhihewa said: “Have you not heard that you cannot get the loin cloth until the
chant in my honor is recited?” Loli replied: “I have told him that, but he replied
by asking, ‘What is the title of the chant of Kakuhihewa?’ I replied: ‘The Mirage

of Lonoikamakahiki?’ This is the reply made by my king, and that is all.” Because
of this reply made by Loli, Kakuhihewa asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is
this chant really in honor of the name of the king of Hawaii?” Lanahuimihaku and his
companion replied: “It is a lie; he has no chant in honor of his name like this one.
He is a chief without a chant. You must not be afraid; make a wager with him.”

chant belonged to the king of Hawaii, the chant was then made the subject of a contest.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10397src" href="#xd32e10397">22</a> After this was agreed on the two kings came together to decide on their bets. Some
time was taken up in this before they agreed upon the different objects for the wager.
Kakuhihewa on his side offered that portion of Oahu from Leahi point to the Kaena
point as against the large feather kahili of Lonoikamakahiki, Eleeleualani. Lonoikamakahiki
on his side would not agree to this, saying: “I will not wager my feather kahili for
that amount of land.” Because Lonoikamakahiki refused to agree to this offer made
by Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa again offered all the lands, in addition to the former offer,
embraced within the point of Kaena to the Kaoio point at Kualoa.

be enticed to follow us out, and if he does, and he gets excited over the sport, he
will surely ask us for hook, line and bait; then we will shame him, for he is a king

<p>When Lonoikamakahiki saw Kakuhihewa setting out for the purpose of fishing, he turned
and said to his retainer, Loli: “I think it a good idea that we follow Kakuhihewa
and his companions and look on while the king of Oahu does his fishing.” Loli replied
to his ward: “You must not urge us to follow out to watch the fishing, for if you
get stubborn I will get killed, because you do not know how to fish.” To this Lonoikamakahiki
said to Loli: “Why should you get killed without any cause?” The attendant replied:
“Here is the reason why I shall be killed: after we get to the fishing grounds you
will see Kakuhihewa and his companions hauling in the fish, <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>and you will get excited over the sport and will have a desire to do some fishing
yourself. Because of that desire you will ask for hook and line, and they will refuse
and insult you with such expression as this: ‘Where have you been that you should
come here unprepared?’ Therefore you will be ashamed; and this will cause my death.”
Lonoikamakahiki replied: “Why should they refuse to give me hook and line? Only the
ignorant will refuse to give hook and line.” The attendant said: “Yes, that would
be the proper way of reasoning if things were right between you, but as things stand
now they do not think well of you, for you have beaten them, and for this reason they
will refuse giving you what you ask.” But with all this advice given by his attendant
the king’s desire to go out was not abated; in fact, the desire became stronger, and
Lonoikamakahiki finally demanded of his servant that they follow Kakuhihewa and his
companions and look on while they fished.

<p>Lonoikamakahiki and his companions in due time caught up with Kakuhihewa’s canoe and

all rules about fishing, kept on going until his double canoe stood directly <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>at the bow of Kakuhihewa’s double canoe, where he cast off the rock that served as
his anchor. This rock was a very small one for the purpose, but to prove the supernatural
powers of Hauna it served the purpose as an anchor, although a strong gale came up
and for a short time it blew quite fiercely. When the storm was blowing, the rock
that served as an anchor for the double canoe of Kakuhihewa was unable to hold the
canoe and so it was carried off to the leeward of the fishing grounds for some distance.
The double canoe of Lonoikamakahiki, however, never moved a bit, and the small rock
held it as though a large anchor had been used. This was because of the supernatural
powers of Hauna.

saying: “Say, Loli! Say, Loli, the fish without eyes of the sea!! Catch us a fish,
Loli.” At that very moment, as soon as the last word was spoken, an ahi bit his hook.
As soon as he felt the bite Lonoikamakahiki called out: “Say, Kakuhihewa, what kind
of a fish have I caught?” Kakuhihewa hesitated for a while, then asked of Lanahuimihaku
and his companion: “What kind of a fish has the king of Hawaii caught?” Lanahuimihaku
and his companion replied: “Name it a shark, because the first fish caught being a
shark there must be a lot of them down below.” Because of this, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>in accordance with the words of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, he answered Lonoikamakahiki,
saying: “It is a shark.” Lonoikamakahiki answered back: “No, you are mistaken, King
of Oahu.” Kakuhihewa then asked Lonoikamakahiki: “And what do you say it is?” Lonoikamakahiki
replied: “This is not a shark, it is an ahi.”

<p>The cause of this dispute was entirely about Hauna. It came about in this wise: After
Lonoikamakahiki had acquired Oahu through their former contests, Kakuhihewa begged
of Lonoikamakahiki to restore to him the island of Oahu, going about it in a way as
though he still owned the island, saying: “Say, King of Hawaii, I think you had better
restore back to me the lands you have won and let our former wagers be done away with.
I think you ought to propose another contest between us, and in case you should beat
me in the new contest then the whole of Oahu shall be yours, including the men of
high rank and those of the low rank.”

<p>This request for a new contest, made by Kakuhihewa, was really the wish of Lanahuimihaku

would be put to death by being cut to pieces. This is the reason why Lanahuimihaku
and his companion had urged Kakuhihewa to beg of Lonoikamakahiki for a new contest.
To this request made by Kakuhihewa, Lonoikamakahiki did not give a subject for their
contest.

his personal effects as well as other things, and placed it in front of him, and then
said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, this calabash is filled with the bones of
the chiefs who were killed in the battle on the top of Puumaneo, because there were

say so because of my knowledge.” Kakuhihewa then asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion:
“Say, are the words spoken by the king of Hawaii true, that he can see the future
and that Hauna is to arrive tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku replied: “It is a lie; he has
no knowledge of the future. We were the two men who were able to tell him of the future
from the time of his father, and this Hauna, who is living on Hawaii, and the attendant
whom he killed when we were out fishing were the only men who could tell of the future;
but the king there knows nothing at all about the matter.” Kakuhihewa then again asked:
“Is it true that Hauna is going to arrive here tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion

<p>Kakuhihewa then said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, King of Hawaii, since we have at last
found a subject for another contest—the matter of the arrival of Hauna tomorrow—let
us, therefore, have one.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “What have you to offer as your
wager? A good contest can only be made when one has something to place as a wager.”
Kakuhihewa said: “Why not let Oahu be offered as against Hawaii?” Lonoikamakahiki
made answer: “When you know that I have already won Oahu you come and again offer
it for a wager.” Kakuhihewa said: “You must put away such thoughts, King of Hawaii.
It was the small Oahu that we wagered before, and large Oahu is still my own.” Lonoikamakahiki
then replied: “It is well, then. The stakes are the island districts. Oahu containing
six districts and Hawaii also containing six.” After this bet was made and agreed
on, that night Hauna arrived in Kailua, and so the next morning Lonoikamakahiki said
to Kakuhihewa: “Hauna has arrived on Oahu.”

Oahu and look for Hauna. When you find him, kill him, and seize all his property,
so that we may be able to defeat the king of Hawaii.” At this Kuleonui started on
his trip around the island of Oahu; but he was unable to find Hauna. He therefore
returned and reported to Kakuhihewa, saying: “I have made a circuit of Oahu but was
unable to find Hauna. He has not arrived even, nor is there a canoe to be seen at
sea coming this way, nor is there one hauled up on the shore; none at all.” At this
Kakuhihewa began to think that he would beat Lonoikamakahiki. Kakuhihewa then went

over by the upper part of Kau to upper Kona, but the messenger that was sent reached
Kealakekua, where Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea were living.
</p>
<p>After receiving the information that the men had come overland, Lonoikamakahiki and
Pupuakea went to intercept them at <span class="corr" id="xd32e11419" title="Source: Puanahulu">Puuanahulu</span>, and that was the place where the men were arrayed in battle formation. About this
time, however, the rebels who were down at Anaehoomalu observed that the clinkers
at Puuanahulu were red with people, which was a matter of surprise to the rebels.
Some of them thought there was a battle being fought, while others conjectured they
were some of their own men, being under the impression that Lonoikamakahiki was still
at Oahu, for no news had been received that he, Lonoikamakahiki, had arrived at Kealakekua.

<p>During the night of the day on which the rebels were surprised, Lonoikamakahiki and
his younger brother Pupuakea, together with the men, came down prepared to give battle.
On the night the men left Puuanahulu to go down, the rebels realized there was to
be war, because there were in the hands of the men torches burning from the van to
the rear of the war procession of Lonoikamakahiki. Then it was that the rebels made

<p>Kauhiakama, having observed the population of Kohala during this circuit, returned
to Maui. Upon arrival there, Kamalalawalu asked him: “How is Hawaii?” Kauhiakama replied:
“Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach, because during my circuit
of Hawaii I did not find a large number of them. I first arrived at Kohala, then traveled
along its shore until Kawaihae was reached and did not meet a solitary man. At the
place of my landing, however, I met a few, not exceeding forty, perhaps, and at Kawaihae
there were some places with few men. I proceeded from Kawaihae through Kona to a part
of Kau, all the way not meeting many people. That is the most desolate place, composed
of nothing but clinkers. I continued my circuit from Kau to Puna, Hilo and Hamakua.
I do not recollect coming in contact with three four hundred (1200) men. On my way
to Kohala I found it to be the only locality which contained some people. Kohala is
depopulated; the people are only at the beach.”
</p>
<p>Kamalalawalu having heard this report from his son Kauhiakama ordered Makakuikalani
to make preparations for war. It has been mentioned in this narrative that two men
came from Hawaii who urged Kamalalawalu to give battle to Hawaii, being Kauhipaewa
and Kihapaewa, the sons of Kumaikeau and another. According to the old historians
it was Lonoikamakahiki himself who sent these two men to urge Kamalalawalu to go to
war with Hawaii. And this is the story told concerning the two men.
</p>
<p>Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s intense desire to wage battle with Kamalalawalu, the
former sent Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa to consult Kamalalawalu concerning it. These
two men arrived before Kamalalawalu without the latter knowing that they were emissaries
from Lonoikamakahiki. On the occasion of the two men meeting Kamalalawalu, they remarked:
“Go and make war on Hawaii, as you can take it if you give battle, because Lonoikamakahiki
has no power, nor has his general either.” Because of the remarks of these two men
to Kamalalawalu, he harbored the idea of going to Hawaii to wage war.

<p>The following is said by some of the ancient historians to be the correct narrative:
Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s desire to test the strength of their two generals, putting
into effect the compliments exchanged between them at the time of the awa drinking
both Kihapea and Kauhipea said to Kamalalawalu: “If you should sail for Hawaii to
give battle to Lonoikamakahiki, let us carry on the war from the top of Puuoaoaka
and Hokuula. Let us occupy these places first; we will then possess the <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>stones<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11603src" href="#xd32e11603">67</a> on the heights and compel Lonoikamakahiki to do his fighting from below; we, being
above, would only have to roll the rocks and thus will the people of Hawaii be defeated
by those of Maui.”
</p>
<p>So said these men to Kamalalawalu, which was nothing more nor less than deception,
expressed so as to bring about Kamalalawalu’s destruction. It was only by such means
that Kamalalawalu’s high ambitions were aroused to wage war against Lonoikamakahiki.

your son Kauhiakama to investigate as to how many people there were on Hawaii. He
returned and made his report to you that there were not many people there, but Kauhiakama
did not see the number of people in Kohala because he traveled on the seashore, reaching
Kona from Kawaihae and arrived on the heights of Huehue. He could not have seen the
people of that locality because there were only clinkers there, having proceeded along
by way of Kona until he arrived at Kau. If he had traveled along the Kona route in
the early morning he could not have met people at that time because the inhabitants
of that section had gone to the uplands and some had gone fishing; those remaining
home were only the feeble and sick, therefore the people of Kona could not have been
seen by Kauhiakama on his tour. Had he gone during the evening he would surely have
seen the large population of Kona because it is the largest district of Hawaii.”

learning that Kanaloakuaana was still living at Waimea he concluded that his first

routed and pursued by the soldiers of Kamalalawalu, and Kauhiakama, and Kanaloakuaana

<p>Kamalalawalu looked and saw that the lava from Keohe to Kaniku was one red mass. Kamalalawalu
was astonished, because the day before he observed that the lava was one mass of black,
but this morning it was entirely red with people. Thereupon Kamalalawalu inquired
of Kumaikeau and the others why the lava was a mass of red: “What does red portend?
Does it mean war?” Kumaikeau and the others replied: “Do not think the red you see
is some other red and not what you assume it to be. It is not war. That red yonder
is the wind. The olauniu wind of Kalahuipuaa and Puako had been blowing in the early
morning and when it is very light and gentle it hugs the lava close. This olauniu
wind on the lava coming in contact with the wind from Wainaualii raises a cloud of
dust covering and hiding the land in the manner you saw yesterday.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">”</span> While cogitating to himself, Kamalalawalu concluded to drop the matter on account
of the deceit of the two old men and the loss of confidence in what Kumaikeau and
the others had said, for the reason that the lava continued to be strewn with people
even to the time of the setting sun. During that night and including the following
morning the Kona men arrived and were assigned to occupy a position from Puupa to
Haleapala. The Kau and Puna warriors were stationed from Holoholoku to Waikoloa. Those
of Hilo and Hamakua were located from Mahiki to Puukanikanihia, while those of Kohala

to encourage Kamalalawalu to do battle. Whenever the two old men heard what Kamalalawalu
and the others had to say as to what they intended doing to Lonoikamakahiki in order
to be victorious in battle, the old men would wend their way to make it known to Lonoikamakahiki
and the others and this duty was generally carried out during some convenient time
of night. The two old men always pointed out to Kamalalawalu and the others where
the battle should be fought, and the suggestions of the old men were always received
with the utmost confidence by him. Therefore Kumaikeau and the two deceitful old men
would in turn inform Lonoikamakahiki. The two old men never suggested any place for
battle which would result advantageously to Kamalalawalu and his forces; on the contrary,
it was invariably such a locality where inevitable defeat would result.

for Kauhiakama, but it was previous to the time of Hinau’s assisting in the escape

roasted, proceeded to search for Kauhiakama. Hinau came to Kawaihae first and from

him and said: “Say, Kauhiakama, remain there until I reach you!” Kauhiakama looking

this was not agreeable to the chiefs’ views and the court of Lonoikamakahiki.

<p>As no incriminating charges could be brought against Kapaihiahilina that would be
entertained by the king, the inferior officers made greater efforts to convict him.
They finally brought the charge against him of having had illicit intercourse with
Kaikilani, the wife of Lonoikamakahiki, brought about principally by the acts of the
subordinate officers themselves who studiously prepared the conspiracy. The inferior
officers being aware of the illicit relations between Kapaihiahilina and Kaikilani
and knowing that it was such an offense from which he could not escape, the conspirators
placed the information before Lonoikamakahiki, who upon hearing of it set it aside
as being unworthy of his royal attention.

he first landed at Kohala, as he desired to see the land which had been given him.

get him to return. The messengers, in conformity with the king’s desire, set forth
and upon reaching Kapaihiahilina said to him: “We come for you to return; we were
sent to beseech you to come back; the king is overwhelmed with love for you and your
appeal for compassion by the chant describing your wanderings; when we left the king
was still weeping.”

the ripe flowers of the pandanus of Pooku and girded together the ti leaves as well

Lonoikamakahiki saw Kapaihiahilina sitting on the sand beach when the canoes were
being hauled ashore. Lonoikamakahiki immediately began to wail and also described
their previous wanderings together. Kapaihiahilina recognizing the king also commenced
wailing. When they came together and had ceased weeping and conversing, then Lonoikamakahiki
made a covenant between them, that there would be no more strife, nor would he harken

that do not appear in the genealogical records from Opuukahonua to Liloa, and even
from then on to Kamehameha. The name of Kualii is omitted in the genealogical records
of the chiefs, but his history and doings have often been spoken of.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13545src" href="#xd32e13545">1</a> It is told that Kualii was once king of these islands, and in one of his characters<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13548src" href="#xd32e13548">2</a> he was known to have possessed certain knowledge from a god, and at times even assumed

<p>Kualii was a celebrated chief and noted for his strength and bravery; he was known
to have won all the battles fought by him, defeating his enemies every time. He was
also known for his great desire for war. It is said of Kualii that he began fighting
battles in his childhood and so continued until he reached manhood. The following
story exhibits some of the extraordinary traits in the character of this man.

In the engagement of Kualii here on Oahu, against the chiefs from Koolauloa, sometime
after the reign of Kakuhihewa over Oahu, or possibly at a time prior to the reign
of Kakuhihewa (the exact time not being very clearly ascertained), which engagement
was to be upon the plains of Keahumoa at Honouliuli, Ewa, he was carried by his men

<p>Kapaahulani the elder and his younger brother Kamakaaulani were men who were in search
of a new master<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13578src" href="#xd32e13578">6</a> or lord, so they composed a mele, or chant, and after it was completed placed it
to Kualii as his name. Shortly after the two men had completed <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>the mele they held a conference as to the proper course for them to follow in order
that they might both reap equal benefit. Following is how they decided which course
to pursue while all by themselves and before the mele was made public:
</p>
<p>“Since we have composed and completed this mele, you (Kamakaaulani) must therefore
go and give its name to Kualii, and I (Kapaahulani) will go to the other chief and
urge him to make war upon Kualii. And when we become acquainted of the place where
the battle is to be fought<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13587src" href="#xd32e13587">7</a> then you are to take Kualii to the place and there conceal yourselves in the bushes.
You are to leave a mark on the road, however, so that I may be informed of your being
there. I will then stand and chant this mele that we have just composed.”
</p>
<p>After completing their arrangement, Kamakaaulani gave out the mele which was known
as the name of Kualii. Some considerable time after this, these two brothers again
got together and decided upon the time when they should bring about what they had
agreed upon. The following is what they said at this last meeting while by themselves:

<p>On a certain evening while the priests and the chief were watching the heavens in

were certain that their army would not be able to overcome the army of Kualii. When
Kapaahulani heard the decision arrived at by the priests of the chief of Koolauloa,
he remarked to one of the chief’s attendants: “You go to the chief and tell him for
me that his priests are mistaken in their interpretations.” Upon hearing this remark
made by Kapaahulani, the man went and said to the chief: “O Chief, that man (Kapaahulani)

Kapaahulani replied to the chief: “Yes, it is true your priests are <span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>mistaken in their interpretations; because according to what I have seen, being also
a great priest, and in accordance with the knowledge gathered by my ancestors and
handed to me by them, your priests have indeed made a mistake in their interpretations
to you, O Chief.” Upon hearing this the chief asked Kapaahulani: “What are your interpretations
then? It is proper that you relate them.” Kapaahulani then replied to the chief: “My
interpretations are these: If we go and make war upon Kualii, we will be victorious
in that battle. I believe that if we could go and make war upon Kualii tomorrow, and
it should happen that we meet him in the early morning, that by noon the battle would

part of Lihue, and from there on down to Honouliuli, till they arrived on the plains

<p>While Kualii was being held up in the koko, standing amidst his warriors, Kapaahulani
still kept on chanting the mele of Kualii, never once stopping to rest, from the time
he began it until both armies met. When Kapaahulani saw Kualii he endeavored to find
some one with whom he could compare Kualii, but try as he would he was unable to find
any one worthy of comparison except Keaweikekahialiiokamoku, the king of Hawaii. The
reason of this was because Kualii was compared to a god.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15990src" href="#xd32e15990">215</a> When Kualii walked from Kahaluu to Waialua by way of the sea, the sea within the

salt water into fresh. When his paddlers became thirsty they would tell Keawe: “Say,
we are thirsty.” The paddlers would then dip up the sea and pour it into the canoe,

into the canoe, and the sea water would lose its saltness and become fresh, and the

together and the battle was declared off. The king of Koolauloa then gave over, or
ceded, the districts of Koolauloa, Koolaupoko, Waialua and Waianae. When the king
of Kauai heard how Kualii excelled over all the others in war, and how he had gained
the victory at the battle of Honouliuli on the plains of Keahumoa, he came to meet
Kualii and gave him Kauai, and by this act Kualii became possessed of all the islands

the elder brother of Kamakaaulani, the one on the side of the king of Koolau, received
great riches from the king. Kapaahulani also became a great favorite with the king,
and the king gave away his own lands to him; and on the same day in which the battle
ended and while on their return by way of Lihue, Kapaahulani was presented with swine,
food and various other things; and when they arrived at Waianae presents of property

words: “Here I am possessed of all this property, while my younger brother and my
wife are without any knowledge of what amount of property I am in possession of.”

<p>Because of these words spoken by Kapaahulani, the chief warrior of the king, in obedience
to the order of the king, picked out a certain number of canoes and loaded them with
some of the presents given to Kapaahulani to be taken to his people. After the presents

<p>In this genealogical tree there are eleven generations from Kapapaiakea<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18305src" href="#xd32e18305">310</a> to Wakea. It is, however, told that the genealogical tree to which Kane is the head,
and the genealogical tree of Kapapaiakea, were handed down by those who had the keeping
of the Oahu genealogy, and these divisions are seen in the history of Kualii; and
the genealogical tree from Opuukahonua<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18308src" href="#xd32e18308">311</a> to Wakea and from Wakea to Kamehameha had been handed down by the Hawaii genealogy
keepers, and this genealogical tree is seen in the history of Moikeha. But the genealogical
tree that is commonly seen these days is the one from Wakea to Kamehameha as told
by Kalauwalu and other genealogy keepers.
</p>
<p>In trying to ascertain the truth of the different divisions of these genealogical
trees one is left in doubt as to their correctness, but in looking them over one cannot
help seeing that each island had a separate tree, the Maui one being different from
that of Kauai. Molokai’s genealogy differs again. In the records kept by the Molokai
genealogist it is stated that Hookumukahonua was the progenitor of the royal family
of Hawaii, but in the opinion of historians they generated from Wakea.

<p class="first">The battle on the plains of Keahumoa at Honouliuli, Ewa, is described in Chapter I.
In looking over the history of Kualii related in that chapter, it is thought to have
been the last battle in which he took part, for in Chapter II it is shown that Kauai
was simply given over by its king to Kualii, whereby the whole group from Hawaii to
Niihau was united [under him]. Therefore it is believed that was Kualii’s final contest.

residing at Kalehuawehe, in Waikiki, at a time when he was about to attain the age
of manhood, he began to be dissatisfied with the king of Kona district, because his
immediate attendants often complained of being oppressed and would come to him with
the following remarks:
</p>
<p>“If your muscular body was only that of a fearless warrior these bones would indeed
be saved: but no, your strength is worthless. Here we are being ordered roughly by
the different chiefs which is so degrading and angers us. In your younger days you
could beat everybody whom you fought against. Being so fearless in your childhood
days, one would think it would continue; yet alas, it was only the fearlessness of
youth.” Kualii replied: “There will be fighting then, since you have found the cause
why I should urge it. A few days hence the pili grass will be reddened.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18332src" href="#xd32e18332">313</a>

<p>On the expiration of the days during which the temple on Kawaluna was dedicated,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18337src" href="#xd32e18337">314</a> the following night the army of Lonoikaika arrived on Keanakamano, as word had been
carried to Lonoikaika that “Kualii has rebelled.” This was the reason why the soldiers
slept that night on the plains of Keanakamano, Kualii in dedicating the temple on
Kawaluna had overstepped himself. Very early that morning Kualii aroused his father
Kauakahiakahoowaha<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18340src" href="#xd32e18340">315</a> with the words: “Say, Where art thou? Rouse up the men, we are now surrounded by
the enemy; there is one army below us, there is another army from Koolau and there
is still another one from Waialua; there is but one pali left, that of Waolani, therefore
you must rouse up the men and get them together as I am ready for the battle.” Kauakahiakahoowaha
replied: “How do you know that we are surrounded by the enemy?”
</p>
<p>Kualii spoke up: “The night tells me that there will be war in the day time, for the
king, Lonoikaika, has remarked, that we have rebelled against him, because we have
come here to dedicate this temple on Kawaluna, thus taking upon ourselves something
which only a great god has power to do.” Kauakahiakahoowaha replied: “Say, Kualii,
since the night has told you that there will be war during the day and you say there
is left us but one more pali, that of Waolani, my idea is this: let us escape by way
of that pali this early morning and return to Waikiki.” Kualii replied: “Why should
we run? Do you suppose that we would be saved by escaping? If we are to die in this
battle, running will not save us, we would indeed die; and if we are to live, we will
surely live.”

<p>This conversation with his father took up a good part of Kualii’s time and the day
grew brighter. When it became broad daylight, Kualii looked forth and behold the pili
grass was red with men; the pili grass of Keanakamano was entirely covered with men.
Kualii at this time covered himself over as though asleep; he was not, however, really
asleep, but he did this to show his father and their men that he had indeed spoken
the truth that early morning. While the men and Kauakahiakahoowaha were sleeping they
heard a great commotion from the mountain, somewhere near Kawaluna. Kauakahiakahoowaha
was therefore startled and looking around he saw that the enemy was already formed
for battle. When he looked down the bottom of Waolani, one wing of the army was climbing
Puuiwa; the army from Koolau was coming down Kaniakapupu, while one of the wings of
the army from Koolau was already on the Kalihi cliffs, and still another wing from
Kona was coming up soon to meet the army from Koolau, whereby Kualii would be entirely
surrounded.

that the different armies were closing in on him, and the grass was so thickly covered
with men that it was dried up from the tramping; he then remarked to his own personal
attendant, Maheleana: “Say, where are you? This morning you must learn how to fight

odds. The rain clouds are encircling from above, from sea-ward and from all sides.”

and lo, the enemy was close upon them. Kualii then reached for his war club Manaiakalani<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18372src" href="#xd32e18372">317</a> and handed it to Maheleana with the remark: “Here is my war club, go out and enter
into the army of Lonoikaika.”

<p>As directed by Kualii, Maheleana went forth and began the slaughter of the people
with such courage that the enemy retired from before him and ran directly toward Lonoikaika.
When these people withdrew the whole of the enemy retreated, those on the pali of
Waolani fell over like pebbles down the pali. Kualii then slew almost all the chiefs
on Lonoikaika’s side. The dead bodies were strewn around like logs of wood, so great
was the number of those that were killed in this battle. Kualii was therefore victorious
in this his first battle and he became the owner of all the land from Moanalua to
Maunaloa. Shortly after this Kualii went and lived in Kailua, Koolaupoko, in a great

<p>While on the canoes that morning Kualii, upon seeing the people, addressed them in
the following words: “You no doubt want to fight Kualii, but where will the battle
be?” The people from the shore replied: “As soon as the canoes land the fighting will
commence.” Kualii answered back: “Let us go to Kalena and fight there. If you insist
on fighting here the canoes will continue by sea and land at Molokai.” Because of
this request of Kualii to go to Kalena and there fight, the chiefs of Waianae consented
because it was but a reasonable request. Kualii, Maheleana and Malanaihaehae therefore
came ashore and proceeded by land to Malamanui. All that night both sides took a long
rest; but early in the morning the fighting commenced at Kalena on the plains of Haleauau,
at Lihue. On the one side there were twelve thousand men, while on Kualii’s side there
were but three men, and yet the armies of the chiefs of Waianae and Koolauloa were
routed. Kualii named this the battle of Kalena.

These were the greatest of the battles fought by Kualii in all the Oahu contests.
Sometime after he had conquered the whole of Oahu he heard that there was a battle
in Hilo, Hawaii; he therefore made up his mind to make a trip to Hawaii with his chief
warriors. When Haalilo heard that Kualii had arrived at Laupahoehoe he immediately
prepared for war, so that when Kualii reached Peahi in Hilo he ran into Haalilo and
the battle commenced. It was of but short duration and Kualii was victorious. When
the chiefs of Puna heard that Haalilo was beaten they too fell back.

again risen against him and were ready to dispute his title as king of Oahu. Upon
hearing this Kualii returned from Hilo to Oahu and found upon his arrival that all
the people, together with the rebellious chiefs, had gone to Waianae to hold a council

were gathered at Waianae, he continued on with his chief warriors for that place.
Upon arrival at the seat of war they looked and saw that the rebellious chiefs had
indeed a very large army. No time was lost, however, for the battle immediately commenced,
and again Kualii was victorious. After the battle Kualii and his chief warriors looked
over the battle ground and saw that a very large number of men had been killed, so
much so that the waters of Kalapo were dammed and a large number of dead bodies were
strewn below Eleu. Because of this great victory certain lines of mele were composed

<p class="first">Sometime after the battles spoken of in Chapter V were fought, where Kualii maintained
his title of king of Oahu, after the land matters were satisfactorily arranged, he
again set sail for Hawaii and landed in Hilo where he took up his residence for some
time. While there word was brought to him of wars on Molokai, where several pitched
battles had been fought and the chiefs were in conflict with one another all the time.
The cause of all the trouble was this: The chiefs on the Koolau side of Molokai were
anxious to get possession of Kekaha, a stretch of country from Kawela to Maamomi;
and the reason why these chiefs were so desirous of getting possession of this section
of country was on account of the fishing. But the chiefs of Kekaha, knowing the value
of these fishing grounds, were determined to hold on to them; so this determination
on their part caused a general internal conflict at this time.

<p>When Kualii heard of this general conflict on Molokai, he left Hilo and set sail for
Molokai. On the way Kualii touched at Honokawai in Kaanapali, Maui, where a chief
by the name of Paepae arrived at the same time. This Paepae was one of the chiefs
of Kekaha, and the reason why he had come to Maui was to enlist Kauhi, one of the
chiefs of Maui, to come to their aid. This Kauhi was the son of Kauhiakama, the younger
brother of Kamalalawalu. Upon Paepae’s arrival at Kaanapali he was told that Kualii
had already arrived there. Upon hearing this he went to ascertain whether it was really
the Kualii who was noted for his great strength. That was the sole purpose of Paepae’s
visit to see and be assured that it was Kualii.

Upon his arrival at Kaunakakai he found that all the chiefs of Kekaha had gone to
Kalamaula preparing for another battle to commence upon the arrival of Kauhi. But

<p>When Paepae came up to the chiefs he was asked: “Where is Kauhi, the chief?” Paepae
replied: “I left here with my mind fully made up to procure Kauhi, but upon my arrival
at Kaanapali I met Kualii, the king of Oahu, so I returned to inform you of this fact
and to urge upon you to try and enlist him on our side, else the Koolau chiefs will
get him first.” When the chiefs heard this they urged upon Paepae to again set sail,
and also sent Kapolei, daughter of Keopuolono, to entertain Kualii. Early that morning
Paepae reached Kaanapali, but to his surprise found that Kualii had already left for
Molokai at dawn.

<p>Upon hearing that Kualii had already left for Molokai, he boarded his canoes again
and returned in haste. While in mid-channel he saw the flapping of the sails of canoes
inside of the reef at Kamalo, so Paepae followed in. Before the several things in
Kualii’s canoes could be taken ashore and before the canoes could be hauled on the
beach, Paepae arrived and moored his canoe at the stern of Kualii’s canoes. Without
further delay Paepae told Kualii the object of his errand in the following words:
“I have come to entreat you to come to our rescue. The chiefs of Koolau have taken
up arms against us with the intention of taking away from us our lands from Kawela
to Maamomi. Because of this desire on their part we have had several disputes and
a battle is about to commence. A minor engagement has already taken place, however,
in which we were beaten. The majority of the chiefs are encamped on the top of Maunaloa.”

<p>When the chiefs of Koolau heard that the war was to be carried into Kalaupapa, the
war canoes were put out from Halawa and from all the Koolau side to go to battle.
But Kualii and his chief warriors, Maheleana and Malanaihaehae, with two other warriors
had already encountered the chiefs residing at Kalaupapa and had defeated these chiefs.
But other chiefs of Koolau and Kona with their men arrived soon after this who were
prepared to continue the battle against the chiefs of Kekaha. In this battle Paepae
was very conspicuous both in strength and bravery, so much so that he and his force
surpassed the chief warriors of Kualii. When Kualii and his followers were victorious
over all the chiefs of Molokai all the lands on the Koolau side came into Paepae’s
possession. This victory was not, however, gained through the use of the war clubs,
but through the use of Kualii’s stone axe named Haulanuiakea. Following is the story
of the destruction of the enemy by Kualii with the blade of the axe.

<p>While Kualii and his followers were floating in their canoes over the sand bar at
Kalaupapa the soldiers from Koolau swam out to the canoes of Kualii with the intention
of capturing them; there were some forties in number. When they got to the canoes
they took hold of them and <span class="corr" id="xd32e18526" title="Source: lfted">lifted</span> them onto their shoulders. While this was being done Kualii rose with his axe in
hand and swung it along one side of the canoes killing those on that side, which caused
the canoes to lean toward that side as the canoes were then on the shoulders of the
men. When Malanaihaehae saw that the people on one side of the canoes were all slain,
he rose and reached for the axe which was being held in Kualii’s hand and swung it
along the other side of the canoes, which slew all the people on that side; and the
canoes again fell on even keel in the sea and floated as before.

<p>Not very long after this some more of the enemy came along, equal in number to those
that had been slain, and again lifted up the canoes of Kualii just as the others had
done, without any signs of fear, although the others were floating around dead. Again
the axe was used with deadly effect and again Kualii and his followers were victorious
by the use of the blade of Haulanuiakea. This was kept up until the whole army was
slain.

this great slaughter at Pelekunu, Paepae stood up in the canoe and spoke to the people
in a boastful manner saying: “You are all slain by the war club of Kualii.” At these
words the people were for the first time made aware of the fact that it was Kualii
that had killed their men. The chiefs of Koolau then gave up to Kualii the whole of
Molokai. It was this battle that a few lines of the Kualii mele speaks of in Chapter

the chiefs as well as to the people, he returned to Oahu accompanied by his companions,
his chief warriors. Upon arriving from Molokai he proceeded on his way to Kailua where
he found that the chiefs and people were all living in peace. After residing on Oahu

<p>Once upon a time Kauhi happened to be in Lanai and saw the king returning to his house
one day after inspecting his skeletons. Kauhi then went into Haloalena’s storehouses
with long poles and knocked down all the skeletons from their places, and he kept
this up until he had gone through all the storehouses of the chief of Lanai. When
the king heard that Kauhi had entered the storehouses and had destroyed all his skeletons
he sent for the son of Kauhiakama and asked him: “Whose mischievous son <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>art thou?” Kauhi answered without fear: “Kauhiakama’s.” Haloalena again asked him:
“Was it Kauhiakama that told you to destroy all my skeletons?” Kauhi replied: “Kauhiakama
did not tell me to destroy the skeletons in your storehouses, but what he told me
was to come and act in a mischievous manner and to be fearless. This was all he told
me; therefore I came and acted mischievously.” This was the cause of the hostilities
between the king of Lanai and the king of Maui, and the reason why the king of Lanai
wanted to be independent and not be any longer under the king of Maui. At this time
the chiefs of Lanai were under the control of Kamalalawalu, king of Maui.

continued on his way to Lanai and landed at Wailehua. Upon his arrival at this place
Kualii saw a fleet of war canoes in Kekaa. Kamalalawalu at this time was on Lanai
with his army waiting for the return of Haloalena when the fight would commence. When
Haloalena heard that Kualii was on his way to this war he decided to wait with his
fleet of war canoes at Kekaa. On the next day the news of Kualii’s arrival at Wailehua
was carried to Haloalena. Immediately upon hearing this he started off to meet Kualii
and entreat him to take up his cause and fight Kamalalawalu.

<p>That night Kualii and the chiefs of Lanai sailed under the lee side of Kaena as directed
by the people who were acquainted with the place. All that night until the next day
Kualii’s canoes were moored along the beach at Manele. [In the meantime Kamalalawalu
was still waiting for Haloalena.] After a time Kamalalawalu grew anxious and sent
for his messenger Hinau and instructed him to make a circuit of Lanai. When Hinau
arrived at Manele he saw Kualii’s fleet of canoes moored there, and according to their
appearance judged them to be war canoes. Upon making this discovery Hinau drew closer
with the intention of ascertaining if they were Haloalena’s. He did not, however,
see Haloalena and Kualii, but by the paddlers he recognized Haloalena’s canoes, and
by the shape and appearance of the others he was positive they belonged to Kualii.

<p>When Kamalalawalu heard Hinau speak of Kualii, he immediately sent for some soldiers
and ordered them to go and bring Kualii. When Kauhi heard the orders given to the
soldiers he thereupon set out and ran to Manele to meet Kualii without receiving any
orders from Kamalalawalu to do so, but took it upon himself to be the first person
to bring Kualii. When Kauhi arrived at the place where the canoes moored he first
looked for Haloalena’s canoes and upon ascertaining which canoes were his, this mischievous
son of Kauhiakama unfastened the rope that held Haloalena’s canoes <span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span>to the shore and dropped it in the sea. At this time a strong breeze was blowing and
the canoes were carried out to sea, leaving Kualii’s canoes by themselves at their
mooring place. Kauhi next took up the rope which held Kualii’s canoes to the shore
and pulling on it drew them toward him and when near he jumped aboard, approached
Kualii and sat on his lap. By the action of the boy Kualii knew he was a <span class="corr" id="xd32e18644" title="Source: mischievious">mischievous</span> fellow and therefore asked him: “Whose <span class="corr" id="xd32e18647" title="Source: mischievious">mischievous</span> son art thou?” Kauhi replied: “Kauhiakama’s.” Kualii again asked him: “Did Kauhiakama

lap.”

to Kauhiakama and asked him: “Is this your son Kauhi?” Kauhiakama replied: “Yes, my

<p class="first">In most of the battles fought by Kualii it was customary for him to accompany his
soldiers. But later on when Kualii saw that his soldiers were proficient and that
they showed great strength he decided to let them go to war by themselves, while he
stayed behind at Kailua. But nevertheless, his soldiers usually told him the time
and place the battles were to be fought, so as to keep the king informed. This was
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span>practice regularly observed. Kualii, however, often went to witness these battles
without the knowledge of his soldiers. In these secret tours of his, he always took
part in the battles against his enemies and carried away the feather cloaks. Kualii
often went out to battle in this secret way and the soldiers were puzzled at certain
things they saw which they were not able to unravel. Every time an engagement occurred
Kualii was there, fighting those who were opposed to his men. At the close of the
battle the men would then see some one come out of the conflict bearing a feather
cloak who would disappear on the way to Kailua. It was no one else but Kualii.

<p>After a while Kualii’s soldiers became very anxious to know who this person was that
always came out from the ranks of the enemy carrying a feather cloak on his arm. So
the soldiers made up their minds to seize him, so that they would be able to find
out who this brave soldier was. Several battles were fought after this where Kualii
joined in without being recognized by his men, and the soldiers began to question
amongst themselves: “Is it possible that this is indeed Kualii? Who can it be?” The
soldiers therefore held a council to decide what must be done to him.

<p>One early morning just before dawn Kualii set out from Kailua; leaving Kaneohe he
went by sea and the sea was dried up. When Kualii arrived at Kahaluu that same morning
he was seen by a certain boy at Kualoa. The boy resided at Kaoio Point. Upon seeing
Kualii the boy remarked to his grandmother: “Say, how swiftly that man runs along
the sea.” The grandmother replied: “Watch him closely; it cannot be anybody else;
it must be the king, Ku.” The grandson then remarked: “When the king arrives I am
going to follow him.” The grandmother replied: “If you are thinking of following your
lord you must carry along these shrimps wrapped in ti-leaf together with the king’s
fan. It is possible that the king may look behind him and see the fan and would like
to know who you are; then make yourself known to him. Don’t go near him, however;
your shadow may pass over the king; and don’t go on his lee side for you may step
over the king’s shadow, but keep at a little distance away from him.”

<p>Just as the grandmother concluded her instructions Kualii passed by. The boy then
followed. Kualii kept on running and passed Kaaawa, then along and over Makaua and
as he was going up the rise from which place you can see Kahana, Kualii looked behind
and saw a boy following him. The king then remarked: “I see there is a boy following
me.” As the king did not wish to be followed for fear that his intention of going
to battle might be known, he ran much faster with the idea that when they reached
the sands of Kahana he would outrun the boy. When Kualii reached the sands of Kahana
he then ran at great speed along the sea, with the boy close behind; when Kualii got
on the other side of Kahana which adjoins Punaluu he looked around and saw the boy
still close behind him. The king then remarked to himself: “Surely this boy is a fast
runner.” Passing Punaluu, Kaluanui and up the summit of Kaipapau, the boy kept on
following close behind till the king reached Waimea; Kualii continued down the slope
and sat down on the other side of the Waimea stream; but the boy remained on this
side at a place called Piliaama where he sat down, as the sun had now risen. The boy
wanted to get nearer to the king, but was afraid his shadow might pass over him, so

<p>Upon their arrival at Lihue they heard that the two armies were encamped at Kalakoa,

behind him, but he and the boy kept on with the desire of again encountering the enemy

opposing king dressed in a feather cloak. Kualii then drew near to the other king

did, he saw to his surprise that the boy was still behind him. When Kualii saw the
boy following he stopped and waited for the boy to come up to him. When the boy got
up to him, the boy asked him: “How are you?” Kualii replied: “Just as usual.” Kualii
then asked the boy: “Where is your man?” The boy replied: “When you took the feather
cloak, I took the small finger and one of his ears.”

<p>When the boy made this answer, Kualii made up his mind that this must be a brave lad.
They then resumed their journey until they reached Kaoio Point at Kualoa, where the
king asked his servant for his malo. Upon receiving it he gave it to the boy to be
his own, and he fastened it to the boy with his own hands.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18685src" href="#xd32e18685">321</a> They then returned to Kailua in Koolaupoko.

With these words Kualii went on and entered the mua. Soon after this the boy heard
the beating of the drum and saw someone coming for him.

<p class="first"><i>The Royal Kolowalu Statute.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18703src" href="#xd32e18703">323</a>—This was the best law during the reign of Kualii Kuniakea Kuikealaikauaokalani.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18709src" href="#xd32e18709">324</a> It was strict, unvarying and always just. It was for the care and preservation of
life; it was for the aged men and women to lie down in the road with safety; it was
to help the husbandmen and the fishermen; to entertain (morally) strangers, and feed
the hungry with food. If a man says, “I am hungry for food,” feed [him] with food,
lest he hungers and claims his rights by swearing the <i lang="haw">kolowalu</i> law by his mouth, whereby that food becomes free, so that the owner thereof cannot
withhold it; it is forfeited by law. It is better to compensate. He who swears must
observe the law faithfully, lest he be accountable to the law of the king which he
has sworn to observe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18715src" href="#xd32e18715">325</a> and the punishment be upon him. If it is simple robbery of others’ food, or of others’
property, then severe punishment shall be meted out to the person who violated the
law. A transgressor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18718src" href="#xd32e18718">326</a> or one who is about to die, is, under the application of this law exonerated of his
death or other penalty. Through the uprightness of his [Kualii’s] law, and the honesty
with which he administered the government, God preserved him, so that he lived a long
life, and his is that notable life spoken of in the annals of the ancient people,
of the king of Oahu, who lived four times forty and fifteen years. In the last stage
of life he was bent with age and withered, with the eyes reddened and bedimmed; and
was carried about in a netting. He died at Kailua, in Koolaupoko, in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1730, in the one hundred and seventy-fifth year of his life.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Kualii is thus shown to have lived to an extremely old age, and to have possessed
unusual strength and vigor throughout. Fornander, in his Polynesian Race, Vol. II,
pages 283–4, furnishes the following additional legendary data and characteristic
final of this eminent worthy:
</p>
<p>“It is related that when Kualii was upwards of ninety years old, Peleioholani arrived
one time from Kauai on a visit to his father on Oahu. Without endorsing the details
of the legend, it suffices to say that a quarrel arose between father and son; that
the latter assaulted the former, and a scuffle ensued in which the old man, getting
the grip of the <i lang="haw">lua</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18733src" href="#xd32e18733">327</a> on his son, handled him so severely that, when released from the paternal grasp,
he started at once for Kauai, and never revisited Oahu until after his father’s death.
</p>
<p>“Kailua, in Koolaupoko, seems to have been the favorite residence of Kualii, and there
he died at a very advanced age. Shortly before his death he called his trustiest kahu
and friend to his side and strictly enjoined upon him the duty of hiding his bones
<span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>after death, so that mortal man should never get access to them or be able to desecrate
them. When Kualii was dead, and the body, according to custom, had been dissected
and the flesh burned, the kahu carefully wrapped the bones up in a bundle and started
off, as everybody thought, to hide them in some cave, or sink them in the ocean. Instead
of which, he repaired to a lonely spot and there pounded up the bones of the dead
king into the finest kind of powder. Secreting this about his person, the kahu returned
to court and ordered a grand feast to be holden in commemoration of the deceased.
Immense preparations were made, and the chiefs from far and near were invited to attend.
The night before the feast the kahu quietly, and unobserved, mixed the powdered bones
of the dead king in the poi prepared for the morning’s feast. At the close of the
meal the following day the kahu was asked by the chiefs present if he had faithfully
executed the wishes of the late king regarding his bones. With conscious pride at
his successful device, he pointed to the stomachs of the assembled company and replied
that he had hidden his master’s bones in a hundred living tombs. The legend does not
say how the guests liked their repast, but the kahu was greatly applauded.”

<p>This hill called Haupu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21787src" href="#xd32e21787">8</a> was a hill situated on Molokai and the chief who lived on this hill was Kapepeekauila
by name and his chief priest was known by the name of Moi.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21792src" href="#xd32e21792">9</a> Once upon a time this hill, Haupu, moved or floated to Mokuola<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21803src" href="#xd32e21803">10</a> in Hilo, Hawaii, carrying along the chief and the people and the things that grew
on the hill. When Hina the mother of Kana and Niheu saw that the land was pleasant
to the eye, she climbed on up the hill with the idea of taking a look at the place.
As soon as Hina was on the hill of Haupu, it immediately moved back to Molokai, thus
leaving Hakalanileo to mourn for her loss. When Hakalanileo saw that his wife was
being carried away he tried to recover her, but found it impossible to do so. After
his failure, he proceeded to Niheu and informed him that Hina had been taken away
by the hill of Haupu. When Niheu heard this report from his father, he said: “I cannot
get her, there is only one person who can do it, and that is Kana. You must go to
him personally; don’t be afraid of him and run away if he should turn and look at
you. Just <span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>keep your eyes away from him.” After Niheu had given these instructions to Hakalanileo,
Hakalanileo turned and went to meet Kana. When Hakalanileo came to where Kana was
living, Kana turned and looked at him and the sight of Kana was so terrible that he
turned and attempted to run away; but Kana called out to him, saying: “What do you
want?” Hakalanileo replied: “I have come to tell you that the mother of you two has
been taken away by Kapepeekauila, the chief of the hill of Haupu. She is now at Molokai.”

<p>When Kana heard this, he said to Hakalanileo: “Go and issue a call that the people
come together throughout Hawaii, and instruct the men to go and hew out canoes, by
which we will get to Molokai, and get back your wife.” With this, the canoe hewers
all around Hawaii came together and a large double canoe of ten [fathoms] in length
was hewed out and made ready, whereupon Hakalanileo went for Kana to voyage to Molokai.
When Kana came to the double canoe he stretched out his hands and placed them on the
canoe and the canoe sunk out of sight; Kana did not even attempt to board the canoe.
Because of this, Kana said to Hakalanileo: “Go and hew out another double canoe.”
Again the people of Hawaii went up and hewed out another double canoe; but the hands
of Kana alone were too much for the canoe, for it too sunk out of sight, thus leaving
them without a canoe to get to Molokai in. Therefore, Hakalanileo went to the presence
of Niheu and reported the matter to him. When Niheu heard this, he said: “You go to
Uli and ask for a canoe; she has the canoe that will take you to Molokai, and she
will direct you what to do.”

<p>When Hakalanileo came in the presence of Uli, she asked him: “What is it you want?”
Hakalanileo replied: “I have come for a canoe for Kana by which he may be able to
get to Molokai to fight Kapepeekauila, the chief that lives on the Haupu hill.” Uli
made reply: “Yes, there is a canoe, it is in Paliuli;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21814src" href="#xd32e21814">11</a> but you must, however, go and call all the people together to go and drag down the

“Say, let us fly away up high so as to be out of the reach of Kana, and from up there,
call out to him.” The two then flew away up high and at a point directly over the
place where Kana was sleeping, they called out to Kana. When Kana heard the call he
reached up with his hands, while still lying down, but did not catch them, though
the effects of the wind caused by the hands of Kana made them swing away in haste,
and in doing this they fell down on the hill of Haupu in Molokai. When the two birds
came in the presence of Kapepeekauila, they told of the man with such long arms that
they reached into the heavens, and that they barely escaped death. When the chief

<p>After this encounter the voyage was resumed until they arrived at Waikolu, Molokai,
near where the Haupu hill was standing, and here the canoe was moored. While they
were mooring the canoe a large rock was rolled down from the hill aimed at the canoe
Kaumaielieli. As Kana was lying on the platform of the canoe, one of the people called
out, saying: “Say, there comes a large rock! A large rock is coming!! We will be killed!
We will be killed!!” At this call Kana heard it, so he reached out his right hand
and held the rock, while with the left hand he reached for a small <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>stone from the beach and placed it under the rock, stopping it from rolling any further.
By this action of Kana the rock was stopped right in the middle of the steep cliff;
and it is there to this day, on the cliff of Waikolu. This saved Kana and the canoe
Kaumaielieli from destruction by the rock. After this Niheu started off for the top
of the Haupu hill, to the rescue of his mother, believing that he could do this with

of ti-leaf of Koaea and the ulei of Nuuhiwa. These things grew so close together that
they served as a windbreak, and no wind could touch the chief’s house, called Halehuki.

<p>When Niheu came up to the fence he beat down the ti-leaf and ulei with his war club,
causing the wind to enter Halehuki. As the wind blew into the house, Kapepeekauila
asked: “What has caused the wind to enter here?” “There is a boy outside with a war
club. He has beaten down the fence.” Hina then spoke up: “It must be Niheu, our brave
son. He is without fear. We shall be killed.” While she was speaking, Niheu came in
and taking hold of Hina started off with her. Before Niheu came into the house, Hina
had told Kolea and Ulili the place wherein the strength of Niheu laid; it being in
the strands of his hair, called Wilikalinoamohalaikaekaeka, and at the same time told
them to take hold of the strands and pull on them which will cause Niheu to let go
of her, for this would cause him to lose his strength.

<p>When Kolea and Ulili saw that Hina was being taken away, they flew and held Niheu
by the hair. When Niheu saw that his hair was being held, he let go of Hina, took
up his war club and struck at Kolea and Ulili. While he was doing this, Hina ran back
to the house, to her new husband Kapepeekauila; Niheu, therefore, walked back to the
canoe, and he was questioned by Kana as follows: “How about our mother?” Niheu replied:
“I had her and we were on our way here when I was attacked; my hair was pulled by
the two birds, Kolea and Ulili. While I was beating them off, Hina ran back again.”
Kana then said to Niheu: “You stay here on our canoe while I go after our mother.”
With this Kana stood up in the canoe and peeped over the hill of Haupu. At this the
hill extended on up and Kana also extended on upward too. In doing this <span class="pageNum" id="pb448">[<a href="#pb448">448</a>]</span>Kana had to go up to the highest heaven, in the deep blue sky and his body was in

<p>When Niheu saw that the legs of Kana were thin and in the form of a spider’s webb,
he felt that it was because he was starving; so he called out in a loud voice to Kana:
“Lie toward Kona, to Uli our grandmother, where you will be able to get food and meat.”
Niheu had to repeat this call for three days before Kana heard him. When Kana heard
the call of Niheu, he bent himself over across Molokai, over the top of Haleakala,
over the mountain whereby a groove was formed across Haleakala which can be seen to

<p>When Kana reached Kona and the home of Uli his grandmother, he laid down by the doorway
until Uli awoke in the morning, and when she came out she saw Kana, her grandson.
She then woke him up and began feeding him. When Kana was satisfied, the increase
of his body began to come down until it reached his feet which were in the canoe,
where Niheu was still waiting. When Niheu looked and saw that the legs were increasing
he arose and cut off one, for he was angry with Kana for eating till satisfied. The
numbness from this cut went up until it reached the head of Kana, and upon informing
his grandmother of this fact, Uli said: “Your younger brother Niheu got angry with
you because you partook of food [without remembering him], so he has cut off one of
your legs.” After this Uli said to Kana: “You have conquered over your opponent. When
you rise up you must extend upward until you tower above the Haupu hill, then make
eyes at the hill and when it extends up to meet you, you reach down and break off
the flippers on the right side; then break off the flippers on the left side; then
it will have no more strength.” After these instructions had been imparted, Kana arose
and stood upright until he towered over Haupu, when he made eyes at the hill. At seeing
this Haupu extended upward to meet Kana; Kana then reached down and broke off the
flippers. As soon as the flippers were broken, the power of Haupu ceased. Kana then
stepped down on the hill and it fell to pieces, and as the pieces fell into the sea,
they were left there in the form of small hills,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22068src" href="#xd32e22068">24</a> which can be seen to this day, at the mouth of the Waikolu Valley, overgrown with

are two contestants playing; when one has rolled his stone disk farther than the other’s,
the multitude would shout. That is the noise you hear.” Pikoiakaalala then asked:
“Let me go and witness the games?” “You cannot go and see them until after today,”
said Alala. After this the multitude shouted again. When Pikoiakaalala heard the commotion,
he again asked Alala, this being the second time: “What is that renewed shouting down
there?” “They are playing at a game called pahee.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22332src" href="#xd32e22332">5</a> When the stick thrown by one contestant slides farther than the one thrown by the
other the people would yell.” “I must go down,” said Pikoiakaalala. Alala refused,
saying: “You cannot go.”

being carried down the rapids. The one whose piece of board floats the steadiest and

the boy started down for Wailua where the people were gathered at the games. On the
arrival of Pikoiakaalala with his koieie the people all looked at him in surprise.
Not very long afterwards the people began throwing their koieie boards into the Wailua
River; so Pikoiakaalala threw his into the river also. When the people saw how his
koieie floated the steadiest, some of the boys got jealous of him and one of them
reached down for Pikoiakaalala’s koieie and threw it into the rapids which carried
it into the sea. As soon as his koieie was thrown into the rapids, Pikoiakaalala jumped
in after it and he too was carried into the sea by the force of the current for two
days and two nights when he landed on Oahu at the harbor of Kou (Honolulu), where
he sat on the sand like a castaway, weak from want of food.

how?” Pikoiakaalala answered: “Yes.” “If you know how to shoot rats,” said the queen,
“then I will stake my property on your skill and you can compete with Mainele.” As

<p>Mainele was a high chief<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22373src" href="#xd32e22373">9</a> and was an expert in the art of rat shooting; he was known to win all the contests
in which he took part. He could hit ten rats with one arrow at one shot. In regard
to the wager: the king staked his property on Mainele, while the queen staked her
property on Pikoiakaalala. The condition was that whoever could shoot and hit ten
rats with one arrow would win, the one failing to do this would lose.
</p>
<p>Mainele took the first shot, and when the people looked they saw that the arrow had
entered into ten rats, so they shouted, “Mainele has won! Mainele has won!” Pikoiakaalala
then sarcastically remarked to Mainele: “How awkward! It is easy enough to hit the
rat in the body because the object is large. I thought you were going to shoot at
the whiskers in order to prove your great skill, but I see I am mistaken.” Mainele
answered: “You are a deceitful boy. From the day I first began shooting rats until
this day, I have never seen a man who could shoot at the rats’ whiskers.” Because
the two were arguing over the matter so long, bets were again made about hitting the
rats’ whiskers. After the new bets were made, Pikoiakaalala took his shot. At this
time there were no rats to be seen, the brush in the near neighborhood was without
rats; so Pikoiakaalala prayed his Kalokalo<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22381src" href="#xd32e22381">10</a> prayer. By this we can see that his parents and sisters must have had the forms of
rats.

the actual rat is hit then the wager is won and Pikoiakaalala can <span class="pageNum" id="pb458">[<a href="#pb458">458</a>]</span>have the stakes.” He said this because they all felt sure that no rat would be seen

<p>We will now introduce our readers to Keawenuiaumi the king of Hawaii. While Keawenuiaumi
was on his way with his canoe makers to the forest of Hilo one day, for the purpose
of cutting down a large koa tree for a canoe, two birds flew on to the very top of
the tree and called out in a loud voice: “Say, Keawenuiaumi, you cannot make a canoe
[out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe; a hollow canoe. A canoe
that will never reach the ocean.”

<p>When Keawenuiaumi heard this call from the birds the tree-felling was abandoned. As
the birds kept up this calling continually Keawenuiaumi became vexed and thereupon
made up his mind to go in search of a skillful archer to come and kill the birds.
About this time the fame of Mainele as an archer reached Hawaii, so Keawenuiaumi made
a vow, “That if Mainele would kill the birds he should receive the king’s daughter
in marriage<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22473src" href="#xd32e22473">15</a> together with a portion of the island of Hawaii.” Upon the arrival of Keawenuiaumi’s
messengers in Oahu, Mainele was informed of the wish of the king. As soon as Mainele
heard that he was wanted on Hawaii, he immediately prepared his double canoe and got
together his men who were to accompany him.

the messengers have just arrived from Hawaii.” Pikoiakaalala answered: “If you wish
me to go along you had better go up and get some ie vines and make a basket in the
shape of a calabash for me to hide in, so that I may not be seen by Mainele, and you
can say that it is a basket for the safe keeping of your god. This will be the means

asked Mainele. “I have a basket where my god is kept. The canoe in which this god
is to be taken, as I want to take it along, must be tabued and no one must be allowed
to take passage in it outside of myself.” This was satisfactory to Mainele. On the

<p>A few words of explanation relating to the basket. This was made with several openings
which allowed a free current of air and enabled Pikoiakaalala to sit therein. After
leaving Oahu to their rear, the canoes after a quick passage, were laid to off the
cliffs of Kaholo, at Lanai, on the afternoon of that same day. In the evening the
breeze from Kahalepalaoa which came directly from behind them sent their canoes flying
along at such a rate of speed that by dawn of the next morning they were able to make
out the waterfall of Kawaikapu on the steep cliffs of Makaukiu, Kohala, Hawaii. At
this place is a sort of a bay surrounded by high cliffs which opens directly to the
sea and which was right ahead of the canoes as they were approaching land; the name
of the place is Kuukuunaakaiole. Pikoiakaalala upon seeing where they were said to
Kauakahi: “Tell Mainele to shoot at the mouth of the rat which is dimly seen ahead
of us.” When Mainele heard this he replied to Kauakahi: “That is not a rat, that is

<p>Upon passing the cliffs they continued on their way to Hilo, at which place they arrived
the next day and landed at Kaipalaoa. Everybody upon landing proceeded to the place
where Keawenuiaumi was at that time residing with the exception of Kauakahi and his
basket. When Mainele saw that Kauakahi was left behind he asked him: “Let us go on
up?” Kauakahi replied: “I will not go on up unless the basket which my god is in goes
with me.” When Mainele heard this, he requested of Keawenuiaumi that men be furnished
to carry the basket along up to the house, whereupon Keawenuiaumi ordered four men
to pack the basket to the house. Upon their arrival at the house, Kauakahi spoke to
Mainele: “I don’t think it right for us to live in the same house with our god; it
is best that you ask Keawenuiaumi that a small house be given me where I can live
with the god.” Mainele therefore requested of Keawenuiaumi for <span class="pageNum" id="pb462">[<a href="#pb462">462</a>]</span>a house for the god and Kauakahi. As soon as the king heard this, orders were given
that a small house be built, which was finished in no time, where Kauakahi moved in

not come anywhere near them on account of the height of the tree. A staging was then
built up which reached about half way up the tree, but even then Mainele’s arrow did
not reach the birds. Pikoiakaalala then whispered to Kauakahi: “Ask Mainele and Keawenuiaumi
why the birds are not hit. Perhaps Mainele was not shooting at them, if he did he
would hit them.” When Mainele heard the remarks of Kauakahi, he replied: “Why don’t
you shoot at them yourself? There are the birds, here is the bow and here are the
arrows, go ahead and shoot, may be you will hit them.” At this Kauakahi replied: “All
right, I will ask my god to shoot the birds.” Pikoiakaalala then came out of the basket
with his rat shooting arrows to the surprise of Mainele and the Oahu people that accompanied
him, for they had not known that a man had been in this basket all this time. Upon
coming up to Keawenuiaumi, Pikoiakaalala requested that a basin of water be brought
and made to stand under the tree. As soon as this was done Pikoiakaalala came and
stood over the basin; while he looked into the basin at the reflection of the birds
in the water, he held his arms above his head with his bow bent and his arrow aimed
at the birds; as soon as he saw that the birds were in line he let fly his arrow which
flew true to the mark hitting both birds and they came tumbling down to the ground.
The people upon seeing this great skill shown by Pikoiakaalala gave a mighty shout.

<p class="first">The land where Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui lived was Lihue, situated below
and to the east of the Kaala mountains on Oahu. The ground upon which the house stood
is “Oahunui”. At this time Kakuhihewa was the king of Ewa and of the districts adjoining;
while Pueonui was the king of the district of Kona, embracing that stretch of country
from Moanalua to Makapuu. At this time these two kings were contending in war with
each other whereby Pueonui was acquiring the Ewa lands. Kalelealuaka was a very brave
and fearless man in battle and in fighting. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui often
spent their time wishing for certain things. The house in which they lived faced directly
towards Ewa.

<p>Usually after partaking of their evening meal they would light their kukui nut lamp
and then lie down with their heads on their pillows, look up at the roof, Kalelealuaka
at one gable of the house and Keinohoomanawanui at the other, when Kalelealuaka would
call out to Keinohoomanawanui: “Let us name our wishes.” Keinohoomanawanui would then
reply: “My wish is this: that we sleep until the first crowing of the cock, then wake
up and proceed down to the plain, pull up some ahuhu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22614src" href="#xd32e22614">1</a> gather them together, continue on down to the beach, pound until soft, put the stuff
into the cracks, catch an eel, return home, put the eel in banana leaves, cook it
in the oven underground; then at the second crowing of the cock uncover the oven and
place the cooked eel to one side to cool; after it is cooled we will then proceed
eating until we have had our fill; when we will retire to our mats, place our heads
on our pillows, face up to the roof and watch the rats race along the battens. That
is my wish, I want you to know.”

<p>Kalelealuaka would then reply: “That is no wish, I have the proper wish.” “What is
your wish?” Keinohoomanawanui would ask. “That we may eat the dogs of Kakuhihewa that
bite the face of people; that we may bake the hog whose tusks are crossed; that we
may eat the fat awa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22624src" href="#xd32e22624">2</a> of the fish ponds; that we may drink of the best and most intoxicating awa; that
Kakuhihewa himself shall chew the awa, strain it into the containers, pour it out
into the cups, place the cups to our lips; and after we have slept off the effects
of the awa, that he bring his daughters and make them our wives. That is my wish,
I want you to know.” Keinohoomanawanui then replied: “Say, we will get killed. I thought
we were to wish on other subjects; but I see your wish is in relation to the king.
If that is your wish we will surely get killed.” This was carried on by these two
for ten nights and over.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22632src" href="#xd32e22632">3</a>

<p>As their lamp was seen burning for several nights, Kakuhihewa got vexed and ordered
one of his spies to go on up and see what this midnight lamp was for. As the <span class="pageNum" id="pb466">[<a href="#pb466">466</a>]</span>spy arrived and stood on the outside of the house he heard Keinohoomanawanui name
his wish, which was followed by Kalelealuaka, after this the two became quiet. The
spy then stuck a short wooden dagger in the ground at the entrance<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22641src" href="#xd32e22641">4</a> of the house and returned to the king. At his arrival the king asked: “What was that
lamp burning for that you went up to see?” The spy then repeated all he had heard.
While the spy was repeating what he had heard to the king, a priest was at this time
with the king. At the conclusion of the recital, the king turned to the priest and
asked him: “What about that man Kalelealuaka? Do you think his wish proper or not?”
The priest replied: “What he has said should be carried out, because he will be the
man to gain the conquest for you, so that you will own the whole island. You must,
however, carry out every detail of his wish with your own hands.” On the advice of
the priest, Kakuhihewa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22644src" href="#xd32e22644">5</a> proceeded to carry out in detail the wish made by Kalelealuaka. The priest had, however,
instructed the king to build two houses, one to serve as an eating house and the other
a sleeping house; both to be built and completed in one day and then Kalelealuaka
was to be sent for and brought down.

<p>Before their arrival at Ewa, Kakuhihewa had in the meantime prepared with his own
hands everything as advised by the priest, as already set forth in this story. The
reason why Kakuhihewa had followed the instructions was because he wanted to gain
possession of all of Pueonui’s lands, and also because the priest had advised him
so. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui were from this time on taken as the king’s
sons-in-law. All Kalelealuaka did after this was to retire with the daughter of Kakuhihewa

<p>Kalelealuaka in the meantime retired during the daytime, but at the first crow of
the cock at early dawn, he would get up and go out and slay the officers in the army
of Pueonui. He would run from Ewa to Kapukaki, the heights looking down at Halawa,
where he would meet the officers of the opposing army and fight them single handed,
striking on the right and then on the left. After slaying the enemy by the use of
his war club he would carry off their war helmets and feather capes. This was carried
on by him for several nights without the knowledge of anyone. One night as he was
returning a farmer at Halawa saw him. Kalelealuaka had slain several of Pueonui’s
men, and secured some feather capes and war helmets and was on his way home; but he
was traveling at such speed that the farmer was unable to make out who he was. On
the night following the farmer thought he would lie in wait for this man; sure enough
he saw Kalelealuaka going along at a very great rate of speed, so taking up his spear
whose point was fixed like a hook, he threw it and hit the man in the arm just above
the wrist; the spear point entered and was made fast. Kalelealuaka seizing the spear
tried to pull it out, but was unable on account of the peculiar point, so he broke
it, leaving the point still in the arm.

woman or child to remain at home, excepting those who when they fell down were unable
to get up again, and those who were so sick that they could not walk. After everybody
had come together, the farmer proceeded to look for his man by looking at their arms;
but he was unable to locate him. He then asked Kakuhihewa: “Is there no one left?”
“None,” said the king, “except my son-in-law who is asleep at home, and has done nothing
requiring him.” “Send for him and let me see [his arm],” said the farmer. When Kalelealuaka
came up to the farmer and held up his arm the point of the spear was found. The farmer
then remarked: “Surely, this is the man that slew all of Pueonui’s men, and this is
the very man whom I saw coming in the early morning while I was on my way to work
and at whom I threw the spear, the point of which is still in his arm. I also saw
him returning with war helmets and feather capes, and I am certain his house must
be filled with those articles; let someone be sent to fetch them.” When the man that
was sent returned, he brought with him several war helmets and feather capes which
made a huge pile, proving that it was Kalelealuaka that caused the overthrow and final
defeat of Pueonui. So Kalelealuaka was made chief ruler, while Kakuhihewa served under

that of his wife, was hog raising. They at one time had as many as ten hog pens; but
amongst his whole herd [of hogs] there was one he thought a good deal more of than
all the others; one that measured over a fathom in length which he had vowed he would
never part from. This hog was to be kept until the death of Pumaia when it was to
be killed.

<p>Kualii who was king at this time, was building the temple called Kapua, which was
situated to the east of Leahi Hill overlooking Mamala. At the completion of the temple,
Kualii ordered that a hog be brought from Pumaia. Upon the arrival of the messengers,
Pumaia asked them: “What is the object of your call?” “We have been sent by Kualii
to you for a hog for the temple. You give us one.” “Yes, you can have one,” said Pumaia.
“There is the pig pen.” This request was kept up until all the ten hog pens were exhausted
and there remained but the one hog he thought so much of. After a time Kualii sent
his men for another hog. Upon their arrival in the presence of Pumaia, they were asked:
“What has brought you here?” “We have been sent by Kualii to come for the hog that
is left.” “You shall not have it. He is only seeking trouble. I thought he was really
in need of swine, but no.” The men then grabbed the hog and fought with Pumaia for
its possession, many against one. In this fight <span class="pageNum" id="pb472">[<a href="#pb472">472</a>]</span>sometimes Pumaia would get possession of the pig and again the others would get it.
This was kept up for some time when at last a regular fight was had. Pumaia then struck
out one blow on the right and one on the left with his fists, killing all the men
except one, who ran to the king, Kualii, and reported to him, saying: “We have all
been killed by Pumaia and I alone am left to bring the tidings to you.” Kualii then
ordered his soldiers and officers to arm themselves with their spears and other implements
of war and to dress in their war helmets and feather capes and when ready to go and
make war on Pumaia.

<p>After this fight Pumaia left Pukoula and moved on to Kewalo where he was met by the
soldiers and a regular battle was fought in which Pumaia slew all of Kualii’s warriors
and officers. One of the men, however, managed to escape and carried the result to
Kualii. When Kualii heard that his warriors and officers had all been killed, he called
all his chiefs and warriors to come together, with his god, Kanemuka. Pumaia in the
meantime had moved on to Pawaa, where he was met by Kualii and his men, and another
battle was fought in which Pumaia again slew all the chiefs and warriors, with the
exception of Kualii and his god. When Kualii saw that his men and chiefs were all
slain he prayed to his god to capture Pumaia, and so through the power of this god
Pumaia was caught and bound. Kualii was so incensed at Pumaia that he was immediately
killed and was dragged to Kapua where his dead body was thrown into the pit with the
men he had killed. In the course of the ill treatment given his body, the jaws were
crushed and cut up into fragments.

<p>Pumaia’s wife and young daughter in the meantime were at home where they were awaiting
for his return, from early in the afternoon until midnight. At this long absence of
Pumaia the mother remarked to the daughter: “Your father perhaps is dead. In all his
travels before this he generally returned home before dark.” While the two were talking
they heard a shaking noise outside the house and an indistinct call to open the door.
The mother then rose and opened the door, and lo it was the spirit of Pumaia.
</p>
<p>Relating to the spirit of Pumaia: It is told in this legend that the spirit is always
much stronger than the living body and that several people have been killed by spirits;

<p>As the jaw bones of Pumaia were so crushed his words were indistinctly heard, so the
spirit had to resort to whispers and gesticulations of the hands, like a deaf and
dumb person, in order to be understood. Pumaia then said to his wife: “I struck out
right and left and killed them all.” The wife asked: “You killed them all?” “Yes,
yes,” at the same time bringing the hands together and making the negative motion
to indicate that nothing was left. Pumaia then said to the wife: “Let us go and get
my body.” The wife assented and took a piece of kapa cloth in which to wrap the body.
The blazing spirit<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22751src" href="#xd32e22751">2</a> then went ahead, the wife following until they reached Kapua, the temple of Kualii
and the pit where the body had been thrown. The spirit of Pumaia then flew and landed
right in the center of the pit and flamed; the night guards were fast asleep, as it
was then well on towards midnight,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22756src" href="#xd32e22756">3</a> the Milky Way being plainly seen. The wife then approached the hole and felt of the
dead bodies. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb474">[<a href="#pb474">474</a>]</span>spirit then whispered and at the same time making motions with the hands to remove
the dead bodies and pointed down in the bottom of the hole. The wife followed the
instructions until she found the body of Pumaia beneath, all ragged and torn. She
then collected the pieces and put them in the kapa cloth, in the form of a bundle,
put it on her back and returned home. Upon her arrival at the house Pumaia’s spirit
told the wife, at the same time pointing at the floor of the house, to remove the
mats, dig a hole and conceal the body, before the arrival of the people who would
search for the body the next day. The wife did as she was told. On the next day a
searching party arrived looking for the body of Pumaia. The searchers asked Pumaia’s
wife: “Did you not go and remove the body of your husband last night?” “I do not know
anything about it nor have I removed it. Is <span class="corr" id="xd32e22763" title="Source: Pumia">Pumaia</span> then dead? This is the first that I have heard of his death.” When the searchers
heard this they were certain that the wife could not have removed the body, so they
returned [to the king].

<p>On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this
coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving
at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.”
At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied:
“Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s
spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take
me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the
mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads
to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the
next day] they reached Nuuanu.

<p>On the top of the left hand peak of the Nuuanu Pali where you come down toward Hoowahapohaku
and look towards the eastern peaks of the pali and right at the top of this left hand
peak is a cave. The spirit of Pumaia flew to this cave and lit there flaming. The
wife with the bones of Pumaia and the daughter then climbed up the cliff<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22770src" href="#xd32e22770">4</a> until they arrived at the cave, where they made their dwelling. At the end of the
fourth day, the last finger<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22773src" href="#xd32e22773">5</a> of food for the daughter was eaten up when the mother said: “I am distressed at your
fate, the one having bones that need blood. Here we are following after the bones
that have no blood, and have left food and meat.” When they woke up the next morning
they saw food, meat and other articles such as kapas, skirts and various other things.
All these things had been brought by the spirit of Pumaia from Waikiki. In that one
night the spirit had traveled over the whole district. This was carried on for several
nights and the food and animals, the fish in the ponds and the growing food were brought
to the cave. The spirit of Pumaia kept up these raids until at last it began to raid
Kualii’s own lands. All the different properties were taken, even the canoes, mats,
war helmets, feather capes, calabashes, water gourds and various other things of the
house and the land. At night, while the people were asleep, Pumaia’s spirit would
enter the house, carry out the sleepers and then empty the house of their valuables.
Upon waking up in the morning the people would find themselves out of doors and their
houses robbed of all the things of value; even the growing crops in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb476">[<a href="#pb476">476</a>]</span>field were stolen by Pumaia’s spirit. By these raids the wife and daughter were able
to have all they wanted and far more than their needs. One day the wife sighed and
said: “Yes, we have all we need, but there is one thing lacking, we have no servant
to do our work for us.” When Pumaia’s spirit heard this, it went off and brought back
a servant for the wife and daughter.

<p>Kualii in the meantime was being puzzled and often asked who this unknown thief could

body is dead, but his spirit is at large and is much stronger than when the body was
alive. You will soon be killed; if you act rightly you will then be saved.” “What

one house for the wife and daughter; one house for the property and servants; and
one house for the bones of Pumaia. After the houses are completed go and bring your
enemy back and take good care of his bones; he may then take compassion on you and

<p class="first">Hanaaumoe was a flattering spirit who lived in Oahu, as the island of Oahu in the
olden days, during the reign of Halalii, was the home of the spirits. The duty of
this spirit, Hanaaumoe, was to meet all the canoes that arrived from other lands and
through his cunning and flattery urge the people to land. In this way several people
were killed and eaten by the spirits. As this spirit had no equal in the art of flattery,
he was delegated by Halalii the king of the spirits to guard all the points along
the coast of Oahu. While he was on duty one day he saw canoes approaching Oahu from
the west. In the double canoe was Kahaookamoku the friend of the king of Kauai, several
men and Kaneopa a lame fellow. These people were from Kauai and were on their way
to Hawaii to make a visit.
</p>
<p>Hanaaumoe upon seeing these people invited them to come ashore: “Come ashore, land
your canoe. Don’t go to Hawaii for that island is filled with spirits. Hawaii has
spirits for Kanikaa lives there. Maui has spirits for Keoloewa lives there. Lanai
has spirits for Pahulu lives there. Molokai has spirits for Kaunolu lives there. Here
is the island that has no spirits; land the canoe. There is food ashore, there are
houses, <span class="pageNum" id="pb478">[<a href="#pb478">478</a>]</span>there are women for each, the paddlers shall have two apiece, as wives, and your chief
Kahaookamoku shall have five wives.”

slept awaiting for the things promised them by Hanaaumoe. Late that evening Hanaaumoe
came to the door of the house where the strangers were sleeping, scattered here and

<p>Certain thoughts then entered Kaneopa that the island of Oahu was full of spirits
and they would all be eaten by them; so he looked for a place within the house where
he could conceal himself. After studying the matter for a while he at last decided
to dig a hole under the door sill; for he reasoned that the king would, upon entering
the house, naturally sit on the door sill. All this time the rest of the people were
in a deep sleep, no one was awake except Kaneopa. Kaneopa was sorry for the chief
Kahaookamoku because he would surely be eaten up by the spirits and Kaneopa was at
a loss to know how he was going to save him. Kaneopa tried to keep himself awake,
but could only last until the crowing of the first cock, when he too became so overcome
with sleep and moved under the door sill and sat in the hole. Just as soon as he entered
the hole, Hanaaumoe arrived and he again called as before, for the third time. There
was no answer. He called again, again there was no answer. Hanaaumoe then said: “You
will surely be all killed. Why didn’t you sleep at Kauai instead of coming and sleep
on the island of Halalii where the spirits live? You are as good as dead, there is
no escape; your flesh, your bones, your bowels, your blood, your eyes, will all be
eaten up.” During all this talk by Hanaaumoe, Kaneopa was listening. At the end Hanaaumoe
<span class="pageNum" id="pb480">[<a href="#pb480">480</a>]</span>returned to Halalii. Halalii then asked him: “How is it, are they asleep?” “Yes, they
are asleep, let us be going,” said Hanaaumoe to the rest of the spirits.

“Proceed and hew out a countless number of wooden images that will look as near as
possible to human beings.” After the images were ready, the king, the priest and a

<p class="first">Lele, otherwise known as Lahaina, in Maui, is the country in which the events of this
legend took place and the time was during the reign of Kakaalaneo who was king of
the whole island of Maui. Eleio was a very fast runner, faster than the wind, and
could make three complete circuits of the island of Maui in one day. Because of his
great speed, he was made runner to King Kakaalaneo. It was his duty as runner to bring
(awa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22939src" href="#xd32e22939">1</a>) fish from Hana for the king. When a meal was about ready, Eleio would set out for
Hana to bring fish and he would always return before the king sat down to eat. Once
while he was on his way back, he met on the road Kaahualii,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22947src" href="#xd32e22947">2</a> a spirit, who asked him for some fish. Eleio answered: “Take the hairs on your behind
for the fish and your urine for water.” When Kaahualii heard this, he chased Eleio.
Upon coming by Kamaalaea, Eleio’s sister who was residing at this place saw that her
brother was out of breath, so she took down her pau and exposed herself to the spirit.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22952src" href="#xd32e22952">3</a> This action so shamed the spirit that it abandoned Eleio. The name of this sister
of Eleio was Pohakuloa. Being chased by this spirit on three different occasions along
this same road, Eleio upon his next return trip went around the west side of Hana
by way of Kaupo. Upon his arrival at Kaupo one day he found a woman by the name of
Kanikaniaula sitting by the roadside, but he passed right along without noticing her.
Kanikaniaula at this want of respect on the part of Eleio called out after him: “Say,
are you going to pass right along without greetings?” When Eleio heard this call he
turned back and greeted her. Kanikaniaula then invited him to the house which invitation
was accepted by Eleio.

<p>Kanikaniaula at the time when this conversation was taking place was dead. Although
she appeared in the form of a live person it was really in spirit. Kanikaniaula was
a very fine woman and came from a line of high chiefs of Hawaii. She, however, upon
coming to live in Kaupo, Maui, married a person of low rank who lived in <span class="pageNum" id="pb484">[<a href="#pb484">484</a>]</span>the back country. Their time was spent chiefly in the tilling of the soil and the
preparation of food, stock raising and fishing. This was kept up until the death of
Kanikaniaula. Upon her death the husband built a tomb,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22961src" href="#xd32e22961">4</a> a small house of poles in the form of a pyramid, in which he placed the dead body
of his wife. When she came to Maui to live she brought along with her from Hawaii
a feather cape which was the insignia of a very high chief, but which article she
had hidden up to the time of her death, nor had she ever once alluded to her rank
as a high chiefess.

then asked the man: “How many days has she been lying there?” The husband answered:
“Two days already, this is the third day in which we are speaking.” “Yes, I will undertake
to bring your wife to life again,” said Eleio. Eleio then proceeded, and at the end
of the fourth day Kanikaniaula was brought back to life and in all respects became
as she was before her death. Kanikaniaula then asked Eleio: “What indeed shall I give
you as a recompense? Shall it be myself?” Eleio answered: “I will not take anything
in payment from you, but I wish you to become the wife of my lord, Kakaalaneo.” Kanikaniaula
consented to this, saying: “Yes, he shall be my lord; but here is a present which
I wish you to take to him; a feather cape.” At this the husband for the first time
was made aware that Kanikaniaula was a chiefess. “You may now return and in the nights
of Kane you may come for me. I am going to my place on Hawaii, and shall return in
a few days.” Eleio then returned [home] wearing the feather cape tied around his neck.
Feather capes at this time were so rare that even Kakaalaneo the king of Maui did
not have one in his possession.

<p>On the day when it was discovered that the queen was with child (the sign being unpleasant
sensations and vomiting although having an appetite for proper things), Kakaalaneo
sent out his messengers to make a circuit of Maui and find out all the chiefesses
who were also with child on that same day. The intention of the king being, to procure
servants and playmates for the coming heir. In due course of time the queen gave birth
to a baby boy and he was called Kaululaau. All the children who were born on the same
day on Maui were brought to the king and reared with the prince Kaululaau.
</p>
<p>As Kaululaau grew to manhood, so also grew his playmates, and as he grew older he
became more and more mischievous. His father Kakaalaneo was then still king of Maui.
In those days it was customary for the boys with him to climb the breadfruit trees
and pick the fruit; and when the fruit got fewer and beyond their reach, Kaululaau
would then pull up the trees with his hands. This was done so often that the trees
became scarce in the district of Lele. At last the father Kakaalaneo, took pity on
the people knowing that they would some day go hungry; so he ordered that all the
boys be sent home to their parents, believing that this would make his son less mischievous;
but instead of improving he grew worse. After considering the matter for some time,
the father at last hit upon a course of action and thereupon told the queen and attendants
to take Kaululaau and abandon him on Lanai with the spirits. This was agreed on by
the chiefs and people and preparations were immediately made; the food and meat were
cooked, kapa and other things were gotten ready and the canoes set out with Kaululaau.
Upon their arrival at Lanai, Kaululaau was put ashore with all the things prepared
for him and the canoes returned.

<p>When Kaululaau landed on Lanai he entered a patch of reeds and slept there. While
in his sleep his god came to him and said: “Say, Kaululaau, get up and enter the cave
with all your belongings.” When Kaululaau woke up he looked about him and saw a cave
opening near by; so he got up and entered it in obedience to the instructions given
him in his sleep. Lanai was an island of spirits. No people could live on this island
as the spirits killed and eat everybody who came there. Kaululaau was, however, an
exception to this as he was not eaten up; but this was because he was too cunning
in telling falsehoods, just like Punia.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22997src" href="#xd32e22997">7</a>

the patch of reeds where he was found by the spirits who asked him: “Say, Kaululaau,
where did you sleep last night?” Kaululaau replied: “In the small patch of thistles.”
“Is that so? No wonder you were not found last night,” remarked the spirits. On the
approach of the next night he again entered the cave, when the spirits went about
looking for him the whole night. At daylight Kaululaau went to the beach on the dry
sand and sat there where the spirits came and asked him: “Where did you sleep last
night?” “In the patch of thorny vines growing there. That is the place where I slept.”
The spirits again asked him: “Where are you going to sleep tonight?” Kaululaau replied:
“In the large surf where it rolls as high as a house. That is where I will sleep.”
On the approach of night Kaululaau would again retire to the cave, and at daylight
go out on the sand where he would be met by the spirits who would ask him: “Where
did you sleep last night?” “In the small surf; you were all at the large surf,” Kaululaau
would reply.

<p>Through these deceiving answers the spirits got so overworked that they mostly all
died off, leaving but very few of them alive. Pahulu was one of the spirits that was
saved, because he left Lanai and went over to Kahoolawe to live. Kaululaau after this
kept a fire burning all the time he remained on Lanai. Kakaalaneo upon seeing the
fire burning on Lanai so continuously, asked the people: “Say, Kaululaau could not
have been killed by the spirits?” “No,” replied the people. Therefore, Kakaalaneo
sent some people in a canoe to go to Lanai and see if Kaululaau was indeed still alive
or not. When the canoe arrived at Lanai, the people saw that Kaululaau was indeed
still alive and he was still keeping the fire burning. The canoe then returned to
Lele and the people told Kakaalaneo, the king, of what they had seen. When the king
heard this he remarked: “Yes, he was sent to Lanai to be devoured by the spirits,
but no! What does it mean? Well and good.” He then ordered a double canoe to go and
bring Kaululaau home. This is how Kaululaau was saved and his history and life on

<p>At the death of Keahaikiaholeha, his body was brought back to Kuukuua, Waianae, where
it was placed in a tomb.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23064src" href="#xd32e23064">2</a> The parents then proceeded to worship the spirit, as was the custom in those days
of Hawaii, until it became so strong that it could go about in the form of a live
person. After the spirit of Keahaikiaholeha had waxed strong, it returned to Waimea,
Kauai, and again took his former wife and lived with her as her husband. The wife
was not aware that this was her husband’s spirit, fully believing that it was her
husband in real flesh. It was while in this spirit form, that he was named Nihooleki.
All he did during the day time was to sleep, not even taking food; the wife being
the only one that took food. When the wife got hungry she would go to her brothers
for food and meat. On one of her calls for food and meat the brothers asked her: “Where
is your husband?” The sister replied: “He is at home asleep.” “You have a queer husband.
All he does is to sleep at home. How is he to satisfy his wife’s hunger? Except we
help you, you will not be able to live.” While this conversation was going on between
them, the husband heard all that was being said and when the wife arrived home Nihooleki
asked his wife: “Have your brothers any mother-of-pearl fish-hooks?” “They have some.”
“Go and bring one.” When the sister arrived at her brothers’ they asked her: “What
have you come for?” “I have come for a mother-of-pearl fish-hook for your brother-in-law.”
“That is right, that will get you something to live on. Here is a hook for the use
of which we will charge ten aku. Here is another one for twenty aku,” etc. The wife
took one of the hooks and returned. When she entered the house and approached where
her husband was sleeping she called out:

<p>When the paddlers and canoe were ready the canoe was taken and left on the beach near
the landing thinking that at the fourth crow of the cock they would make their start,
as was the custom with the fishermen of those days; but it was not to be in this case.
At the first crow of the cock the men got to the canoe; at the last crowing of the
cock they pushed the canoe out. By this time all the other fishermen were out at sea.
The men, however, still waited until daylight. When it became light enough to distinguish
the features of the men they went back to the house feeling indifferent.

<p>In the meantime Nihooleki was still in bed with his senses, however, all alert. The
wife aroused him: “Wake up and make a start; this is the coolest time for the fishermen,
when one is not made lazy by the heat of the sun.” He answered: “Wait until it is
light; at sunrise.” Nihooleki then arose, got the bailing cup, reached for the calabash
in which were kept all the fishing utensils, affixed his malo, then went out to the
canoe and with one hand pushed it out into the sea. The paddlers then came down and
jumped aboard. As soon as they got under way Nihooleki took out the fish-hook and
began fishing. The aku came in such large numbers that in no time the canoe was loaded.
They took this catch and threw it ashore. They went out and got a second canoe load
and again it was thrown ashore. This was kept up until six canoe loads had been landed.
By this time a large mound of fish had been piled up. The wife proceeded to give away,
feed the pigs, give some to the loafers, sell some, and salt some, but a large number
were still left over, there being so many. The people from the uplands came down with
food, sugar-cane, bananas and everything else good to eat and all went home with fish,
even those that came down without anything went home with their share. Those who were
still in the uplands when they heard of the fish came down and returned with their
share.

fishing, sailing right along by them. When his brothers-in-law saw his well-formed
body they called out, “Puipuiakalawaia,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23127src" href="#xd32e23127">4</a> making this his third name. Upon their arrival at Makaena, off Waianae, the men looked
up and saw that they had reached the island of Oahu. Nihooleki again fished until
the canoe was filled with aku. He then ordered his men to eat. After their meal when
every one was satisfied the remaining fish were thrown out until the canoe was bare,
when they set off until they landed at Kaunolu, in Lanai, where they again caught
some fish and eat till satisfied. Again they set sail until they reached Keauhou,
at Kona, Hawaii, when Nihooleki told his men: “You may all go ashore here while I
remain with our canoe. When you go ashore, take each of you one aku apiece. There
are twenty of you, making twenty aku. When you get to that shed of coconut leaves
in front of that house, where women are seated, throw down the fish, but don’t look
back.” The men then went ashore while Nihooleki turned the canoe around. On the return
of the men they immediately set sail for Kauai, and the same day reached the Kauai
waters where the brothers-in-law were fishing. Nihooleki produced the hook and again
the aku came tumbling into the canoe until it was sunk deep in the water with fish.
When the brothers-in-law looked up they saw the canoe and the fish; the canoe was
so full that the men had to stand up. Upon their return to shore Nihooleki took up

the great catches said: “I could get some of that fish if I can only get down to the
coast.” Kamapuaa was the friend of Nihooleki; he was afflicted with the dropsy and
was not able to walk; therefore some people carried him down to the beach; but being
very heavy the men could only carry him a little ways at a time. By constant begging
he however managed to get to the seashore. Before Nihooleki set out on a certain day

<p>When Nihooleki and Kamapuaa were ready to leave Waimea and the wife, Nihooleki addressed
his wife saying: “When you give birth to the child within you, call him by my name,
Keahaikiaholeha. Here are the tokens by which I shall know him should he search for
me, my club and my feather cape.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23140src" href="#xd32e23140">5</a> When the wife heard these instructions she wept: by these words the wife knew that
this was her own husband, Keahaikiaholeha. When the chiefs and his brothers-in-law
heard that this was the king, they came chasing after him. He and his friend then
dove into the sea and swam under water until they came up at Kuukuua, at Waianae.
One of the Kauai chiefs, however, came following behind them named Pohakuokauai, the
same being that rock which is seen at Waianae even to this day. As they drew near
to the house where the parents and sister of Nihooleki were living and near to the
tomb where his dead body was laid, Nihooleki then turned to his friend and said: “Where
are you? When you reach our parents ask them: ‘Where is my companion that came along
with me?’ They will then give you an answer. Then ask them where certain things that
belonged to me are. Proceed and take up the threshold where you will find my war helmet;
under the place where our sister sleeps you will find a feather cape; at the foot
of her sleeping place you will find the lei palaoa;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23143src" href="#xd32e23143">6</a> and at the corner in the house is a kahili. Take our sister and make her your wife
as she is fair to look upon and is also of proper age.”

<p>At the close of his friend’s instructions, Kamapuaa continued on his way until he
came in the presence of his friend’s parents and sister. After proving himself a friend
of Nihooleki’s by producing the different articles in obedience to the instructions
given him by his friend he was married to the sister of Nihooleki. Keahaikiaholeha,
who was Nihooleki, entered the tomb and disappeared. Thus ends this story.

day. These people were chiefs of the district of Puna, of very high rank, as were
their ancestors before them.

<p>One night Kiinoho had a dream, wherein he was instructed by a spirit as follows: “You
two must go to Paliuli and live there, you and Kiihele; you will find all your needs
supplied without fatigue.” Kiinoho dreamed the same thing for three nights before
he spoke of it to Kiihele. Kiihele was, however, very indifferent about the matter
and did not believe in what Kiinoho told him. Shortly after this they both had the
same dream repeated to them. At daylight they talked the matter over and decided that
they must accept the invitation and go and live in Paliuli. They then made their preparations
and procured certain things by the <i lang="haw">lau</i> (four hundred), such as hogs, awa, fish, fowls, kapas and malos. That night they
retired early and at the second crowing of the cock in the early dawn, while it was
still dark, they got up and started for Paliuli without the knowledge of their sister

is going to eat them?” Kiinoho replied: “Our son Kepakailiula. Let us go and <span class="pageNum" id="pb500">[<a href="#pb500">500</a>]</span>bring him here.” They then proceeded from Paliuli and went down to Keaau, where their

<p>Before these two went to Paliuli, however, Hina showed signs of being with child.
Upon their return she was almost ready to be confined. After greetings were exchanged
and their weeping ended, Hina rose and went out to relieve herself. As Hina rose to
go out, Kiinoho requested Kiihele to go out, saying: “Go out and get the child.” Kiihele
asked: “Where is it?” “At the place where Hina is sitting.” When Kiihele came to the
place he saw an egg lying on the ground. He took it up and wrapped it in a feather
cape; and they returned to Paliuli, where Kiinoho exercised all his powers and at
the expiration of ten days and nights<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23278src" href="#xd32e23278">8</a> he unwrapped the feather cape and saw the egg had formed into a beautiful child;
after inspecting it they concluded there was none like him. The child was again wrapped
up in the feather cape and left for a period of forty nights before they again looked
at it. When they did they saw that the child had grown more beautiful; no pimples,
no deformities, straight back, open face;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23284src" href="#xd32e23284">9</a> its skin and eyes were as red as the feather cape which enwrapped him. Thus did Kepakailiula
become the fire that lighted up Paliuli by day and by night, whose only equal was
Pele of Kilauea. Pele gave light from the crater of Kilauea, while Kepakailiula gave
light from Paliuli, giving Puna and Hilo two red objects to view by day and by night.
Kepakailiula was therefore called “The first-born of the beloved one<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23287src" href="#xd32e23287">10</a> of Paliuli.” Kepakailiula would not touch either ordinary food or meat; all he eat
was bananas, one bunch for each meal.

<p>As Kiinoho and Kiihele were one day looking at the child they saw that he had now
come to that age when the company of a woman would be acceptable, one of them then
said: “You are indeed good to look upon, but there is one thing lacking, you have
no wife.” Kiinoho then said to Kiihele: “You must go in search of a wife for our son.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23294src" href="#xd32e23294">11</a> Kiihele consented to this and started off going by way of Hilo until he came to a
woman by the name of Kukuilauania. He looked her over and admired her beauty; yes,
she was indeed good looking, but she had one fault, her eyes bulged out like the nut
of the kukui. He therefore gave up Kukuilauania and continued his search, passing
from Hilo into Hamakua. Failing to find one to his liking, he passed on into Kohala
where he was still unable to find a woman. After looking over the dark rocks of Kaniku
he decided to return. Upon his arrival at Paliuli, Kiinoho asked him: “How was your
journey?” Kiihele replied: “I have found no wife.” On this same day, he [again left
Paliuli and] continued his search into Puna, until he met a woman by the name of Kahala.
She was very beautiful, except that her posterior resembled the pandanus fruit of
the present day, so he passed on into Kau where he found Manienie. She too was very
beautiful, but her lips were deformed so he discarded her and continued his search,
Kiihele left Kau and passed into Kona where he found Makolea, a woman who was as faultless<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23299src" href="#xd32e23299">12</a> as the full moon. Kahaluu was her father and Keauhou was her mother. Makolea, however,
had been pledged to marry Kakaalaneo the king of Maui, for Makolea was a princess,
her parents being the king and queen of Kona. <span class="pageNum" id="pb502">[<a href="#pb502">502</a>]</span>When it was reported that Kakaalaneo was so expert a spearsman, that he could hit
a blade of grass, an ant, or a flea, at one throw of the spear, the parents became
afraid and gave Makolea to Kakaalaneo.

it was impossible to see the waves. On this voyage Kepakailiula and his young wife
Kapuaokeonaona, his two foster fathers Kiinoho and Kiihele and their wife were in
one canoe; Kukuipahu was all by himself in his canoe, while the rest of the people
in their canoes followed behind. The entire distance from Kohala to Hana was covered
with the canoes making the Alenuihaha channel look red: hence the old saying, “Kohala

canoe was the only one that landed while the others laid to in the offing. Kepakailiula
upon jumping ashore was urged upon by his fathers, Kiinoho and Kiihele, that they
be permitted to follow him, but their son would not consent to their coming ashore,

<p>Hana on this occasion was filled with the chiefs and men, who were ready to fight
for Kakaalaneo their king. As Kepakailiula stood on the sand, the crowd shouted in
admiration of his beauty and manliness. He then walked further inland until he reached
solid ground, where he stood twirling his war club called Oleloikahie. Kakaalaneo
upon seeing Kepakailiula came up to meet him, holding two spears, one in his right
hand and one in his left. Kakaalaneo was noted as a spearsman from Hawaii to Kauai.
No chief or soldier equaled him for his great strength. He could hit a blade of grass,
an ant, and even a flea with his spear. Because of this great skill and strength,
the kings of Hawaii, Oahu and Kauai were afraid of Kakaalaneo.

the spear to pass between the arm and body, when he closed his arm on it and held

swung his war club Oleloikahie upwards and struck his opponent between the legs which
cut him in two. Kakaalaneo with his last gasp then cried out: “Ye chiefs of Maui,
are you then to see me thus die without rendering me some assistance?” At this the
Maui chiefs and warriors jumped on Kepakailiula. Kepakailiula dropped his war club
and met them with his hands, catching those that came near him and breaking them in
two, allowing none of the chiefs to escape. The soldiers when they saw this turned
and fled. Kiinoho and Kiihele then jumped ashore and entered into the fight thus making
three on their side. Kepakailiula led the fight uprooting the trees and rocks on his
way and rolling them onto the enemy. When Kukuipahu saw his son-in-law causing a great
slaughter amongst the people he took up the young wife in his arms, ran in front of
Kepakailiula and stood her up. When Kepakailiula saw it was his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona,

The chief consented to this and sailed for Oahu, taking with him his two wives, and
his foster fathers with their wife. Upon their arrival at Oahu they landed at Waikiki,

joining the bathers took the surf breaking over that place known as <span class="corr" id="xd32e23427" title="Source: Kalehuaawehe">Kalehuawehe</span>.

<p>The king of Kauai at this time was Kaikipaananea. He was noted for his great strength
in wrestling, both in the open way, catch-as-catch-can, and in the style where they
get down on all fours. No man at the time was found that could throw him. He was also
very skillful in giving and solving riddles; he was known to win on every occasion.
He was, however, without a wife. Keaumiki and Keauka were his guardians and immediate
attendants. When Makolea arrived at Kauai, she became the wife of Kaikipaananea the
king.

<p>Upon the disappearance of Makolea the people were greatly excited and began to think

<p>When Kepakailiula arrived at Waimea, Kauai, where he landed, he took his canoe and
broke it into small pieces<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23446src" href="#xd32e23446">22</a> and left them on the shore. He then started off until he came to a man of note, who
was very wealthy, a high chief under Kaikipaananea. When Kepakailiula met him he was
taken in and made the friend of this chief. On the next day he asked his friend: “What
is the cause of the shouts in that house where the people are gathered?” His friend
replied: “That is our king, Kaikipaananea, he is wrestling. After that they will have
a boxing match, and then they will give and answer riddles; no one can beat him, he
is always the winner.” Kepakailiula again asked: “Can it be seen?” “Why not?” “Let
us go there then?” When they arrived the place was packed with people.
</p>
<p>Kaikipaananea upon seeing Kepakailiula called out: “Say, will the stranger join in
the wrestling matches?” “I am not versed in such sport.” “Let us box then.” At this
Kepakailiula gave his consent saying: “All right, I know something of that game, but
not very much. I am, however, willing to try with the son of the soil.” Upon taking
their positions, Kaikipaananea after a while hit Kepakailiula which stunned him and
caused him to stagger, but he did not fall. Kepakailiula then struck a blow at Kaikipaananea
which knocked him down. He laid on the ground for a period of time long enough to
cook an oven of food when he arose and said: “Yes, that was certainly good, you make
an interesting opponent.”

<p>After this Kepakailiula and his friend returned home. On the day following they again
resorted to the king’s games where another boxing match was had in which Kaikipaananea
broke an arm. At the close of the games they came home.
</p>
<p>Soon after they reached home, the king’s public crier, named Kukaea (this man lived
on the filth of Kaikipaananea, never having tasted food or meat from his childhood),
arrived crying: “Everybody is commanded to be at the king’s audience on the fourth
day to answer the king’s riddles. No man, woman or child shall stay at home, excepting
those who are unable to walk.” As Kukaea approached the house where Kepakailiula was
staying, Kepakailiula called out to the public crier: “Come.” His friend spoke up:
“He is a filthy man, he lives on nothing but the king’s excrement.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23455src" href="#xd32e23455">23</a> Kepakailiula answered: “You call him.” When Kukaea came up to them, he said: “I am
a filthy man, I live on filth. I am offensive to the smell.” Kepakailiula ordered:
“Open your mouth.” Kukaea opened his mouth when water was poured into it and he was
requested to wash himself, then new clothes were offered him. Then food and pork were
given him and he sat down and eat until he was satisfied. Then he turned to Kepakailiula
and said: “What shall I give you in return for your kindness, in giving me food and
meat. I have traveled around Kauai but no one ever fed me as you have done this day.
Here at last I have found that food and pork are pleasant to the taste. I will pay
you by giving you the answers to the king’s riddles, for no other person <span class="pageNum" id="pb514">[<a href="#pb514">514</a>]</span>knows them but myself, the king’s personal attendant.” Kepakailiula then asked him:

<p class="first">Wahanui was the king, Kilohi was the prophet and Hawaii the land they lived in. Boarding
his double canoe, he left Hawaii and set sail for Kaunolu, Lanai. The reason of this
journey made by Wahanui was on account of an oath made by him, “When I step on the
breasts of Kane and Kanaloa, then will I return to Hawaii.” Before Wahanui sailed
from Hawaii, Kane and Kanaloa, together with their younger brother Kaneapua, were
living at Kaunolu, Lanai. They were three gods who sometimes changed into other forms.
Kane and Kanaloa taking the form of birds, while Kaneapua very often had a human form.

<p>Once upon a time they became very thirsty, so Kane and Kanaloa requested their youngest
brother to go to the uplands of Lanai for water, at a spring called Nanaihale. Upon
the arrival of Kaneapua at the spring with his water jug, he urinated by the edge
of the spring before he stooped down to fill his jug; he did not know that his urine
had run into the spring. When he arrived home and met Kane and Kanaloa, they reached
out for the water jug and each took a drink. When they had satisfied their thirst
they discovered that it was urine instead of water, so they flew off and left Kaneapua
on Lanai.

<p>While Kaneapua was one day seated by the seashore on the Kaunolu point, he saw the
double canoe of Wahanui passing by, so he called out from the shore: “Whose canoe
is that?” “It is Wahanui’s,” replied the prophet Kilohi. “Wahanui is the chief, who
is the prophet?” “Kilohi.” Kaneapua again asked: “A canoe, sailing where to?” “It
is a canoe sailing to Tahiti to step on the breasts of Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua
called out: “Why not let me come too?” Kilohi answered: “The canoe is already loaded
down.” “If the canoe is loaded down, let me ride on the sticks connecting the canoe
to the outrigger.” “They are also overcrowded.” “Let me ride on the outrigger then.”
“That too is overcrowded.” This conversation was carried on until every part of the
canoe was requested for. Kaneapua then called after he had been denied a seat on any
part of the canoe: “Return, it is going to be stormy.” Kilohi replied: “Who are you
that shall cause my lord’s canoe to return?”

<p>After leaving the Kaunolu point, they continued on their way until they were off the
Kaena point, where they encountered a heavy wind; soon after this a storm arose and
the canoe was overturned. Wahanui the chief got a severe cold and the things in the
canoe were wet: so they returned and landed at Lele, in Lahaina. After spending the
night at this place they again set out the next day. Upon passing by Kaunolu, Kaneapua
again called out as before, and again the prophet, Kilohi, refused to allow him to
come aboard. Not very far from this place they again were caught in another <span class="pageNum" id="pb518">[<a href="#pb518">518</a>]</span>storm and were forced to return a second time. On this return Wahanui began to realize
how true the boy Kaneapua predicted and that he was much smarter than his prophet,
Kilohi. On the next trip Kaneapua was given passage and the journey was then resumed.
There were two sailing masters aboard, Hookele i Hilo and Hookele i Kau.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23689src" href="#xd32e23689">1</a> Kaneapua sat behind the sailing masters. As soon as Kaneapua took his seat a thick
fog was seen to approach them and before very long a thick darkness enveloped them;
so thick indeed that those in the aft part of the canoe could not see those in the
fore part. This darkness prevailed until they arrived at the land of Kanehunamoku,
a land which appeared to them in the form of a dog. Kilohi said to Wahanui that it
was a dog and begged him that they return to Hawaii and kiss the children and wives
ere they be eaten up by the man-eating dog of Hina. At this it was made evident to
Wahanui, that Kilohi was not the great priest that he had all along thought him to
be, and that they would all have been killed if Kaneapua had not been allowed to join
them.

<p>At this fear expressed by Kilohi, Kaneapua said reassuringly: “You are entirely mistaken,
Kilohi, that is the land of Kanehunamoku. Upon seeing you to be a stranger the land
is hidden from view, when it becomes clear [it will be seen]. There are people on
the land as you can hear their voices.” When they drew nearer to the place they saw<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23694src" href="#xd32e23694">2</a> that it was land, they also saw a man who was gathering coral for food, a death-dealing
food. Soon after this they left the land of Kanehunamoku and continued on their way.
After they had sailed for some time they looked up and saw two hills, Paliuli and
Palikea which appeared to be moving and towering above and ahead of them. These two
hills were two demi-gods sent by Kane and Kanaloa who desired their destruction. Kaneapua
said to Wahanui and Kilohi: “That is death, if those hills should crumble and fall
on us we shall all be killed. They have been sent by Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua then
called out to Paliuli and Palikea: “Return down below else I shall be killed and you
two will be ashamed.” At this call the two hills were shamed and the travelers were
saved. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “You float here while I dive down below. Honunuikuaeaea
my grandmother is down there; if her back is turned up it will mean our death, but
if it is turned down, we will be saved.” He then dove down and called out: “Honunuikuaeaea,
turn your face upward.” She then turned her face upward and called out: “Whose offspring
art thou?” “Yours.” “What is your name?” “Kaneapua.” The grandmother then fell on
him and wept, and then asked him: “What is the object of this journey that brings
my lord here?” “I want a rope to moor the canoe with.” She then gave Kaneapua her
intestines and Kaneapua rose to the surface and tied the rope to the canoe.

<p>Kane and Kanaloa soon after opened the calabash in which was kept the wind of Laamaomao.
The wind came up, a storm arose, the sea became rough, the waves beat down and broke
over them causing the coral to be thrown up on the shore. This storm lasted ten days.
When the storm abated the travelers once more thought of safety and that all their
troubles were about over; but there yet remained one more object to be encountered,
a dog that belonged to Kaneapua. They then landed and <span class="pageNum" id="pb520">[<a href="#pb520">520</a>]</span>moored their canoe. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “Go until you find three men who
are lying down face up; they are Kane and Kanaloa, and the third one is Mauli. Step
on the breasts of all three of them and return, but don’t look backward.” Wahanui
then went on his way and after carrying out the instructions he returned. Kaneapua
then instructed his companions, saying: “You must now wrap me up and make me appear
to be striped and say that I am your god, Kaneapua.” When Wahanui heard this he went
down on his knees before Kaneapua and offered him all the things of value brought
by him; this being the first time that he was made aware that this person who had
been with them all this time was Kaneapua. Shortly after this all manner of spirits<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23703src" href="#xd32e23703">3</a> gathered and asked: “Where is your god?” “Here it is standing.” “Yes, you have a

<p>On the return voyage Wahanui first landed at Kauai, where they met a great crowd of
people together with the king Kupakoili and his prophet Luluupali. Because of the
shouts made by the people ashore Wahanui went ashore with his present.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23725src" href="#xd32e23725">5</a> When the people saw this strange object they gave a mighty shout. When Kupakoili
heard the shout, he inquired of his prophet, Luluupali: “How can I get possession
of that image?” Luluupali answered: “Kill the king and his people and burn up the
canoes.” This advice was carried out by Kupakoili, and Wahanui was killed and his
image taken away. One man, however, escaped; he was one of the bailers; he dove into
the sea and escaped. After a time he took unto himself a wife, a Kauai woman and settled
there, taking up fishing as his occupation. It was this man’s usual custom while on
his fishing trips to carry a large quantity of food along with <span class="corr" id="xd32e23728" title="Source: hin">him</span>. After he had done this for some time his wife began to be inquisitive and at last
asked him why he took so much food; he answered: “What fault is there in taking this
food? Food is easily brought back again.” Shortly after this while out fishing, a
storm came up and he was blown out to sea, and after a number of days he managed to
land on Hawaii. When he met the people he told them that Wahanui and his followers
had all been killed in Kauai, and that he was the only one who escaped. A proclamation
was then issued calling the people of Hawaii to come together and to make preparations
for avenging the death of <span class="pageNum" id="pb522">[<a href="#pb522">522</a>]</span>their king. A double canoe was then sent to Kauai to invite Kupakoili and his people
to come to Hawaii and get all the canoes and all the property on that island. The
invitation was as follows: “Let no man, woman, or child remain, all must sail for
Hawaii.” This invitation was accepted and all the people sailed for Hawaii where they
were all killed; no one escaped.

<p>The reason why Kaulu <span class="corr" id="xd32e23777" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> in his mother’s womb so long was because Kamano had said that he would kill the next
child. On hearing this Kaulu <span class="corr" id="xd32e23780" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> in the womb. When Kaeha the oldest brother heard that the next child was to be killed,
he asked Kamano: “Why should you kill the next child?” When Kaulu heard Kaeha say
this he said to himself while still in the womb: “There, I see I will live. You will
save me. Well and good, if you save me then I will take care of you.”
</p>
<p>When Kaulu was born he was in the form of a piece of rope, having no human form. When
Kamano, the angry brother saw that it had no human form, he said: “If you had a human
body I would kill you.” Kaeha on the other hand took up the piece of rope, Kaulu,
and put him up on a shelf, where he remained until all of thirty days had gone by
without being once looked at. Kaeha in the meantime had been carried off by the spirits
and was left in a certain place in the sky, or heaven, called Lewanuu and Lewalani<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23785src" href="#xd32e23785">1</a> where Kane and Kanaloa had their home.

<p>Kaulu remained on the shelf until he turned or received a human body. This shelf was
used for the purpose of stowing away kapas. When he awoke he looked around the inside
of the house and saw that his oldest brother Kaeha was missing. He then proceeded
out of the house and looking up he saw that his brother had been carried up by the
spirits to the Lewanuu and <span class="corr" id="xd32e23795" title="Source: Levalani">Lewalani</span>. At this he started off in search of his brother Kaeha. Upon coming to where the
heavy surf was beating he inquired of the surf: “I say, this high surf are you strong?”
The surf replied: “Yes.” Kaulu asked: “What is your strength?” “I strike from above
and when I catch them I give them a good soaking,” said the surf. Eight surfs then
struck Kaulu, but he was not injured. Kaulu then asked of his hands: “Say, Hakaukahi
my right hand and Limapaihala my left hand.” “What is it?” asked the two hands. “Flamed
is the upper jaw, flamed is the lower jaw.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23798src" href="#xd32e23798">2</a> Kaulu then reached for the surf and broke it into small pieces, thus making the surf

look white, you have no strength.” The waves replied: “We are strong and also brave.”
A fight was then had in which he killed both of his opponents; therefore the waves
are small to this day. After this he continued on his way until he met Kuililoloa,
a dog that was guarding the land and the sea. Another battle was fought in which Kuililoloa
was torn to pieces, therefore the dogs are small to this day.

<p>When Kaulu arrived in the land where his brother was living, he approached the house
and hid himself within the leaf of a palm tree. At dusk that evening the spirits asked
Kaeha: “Let us prepare some awa.” They then all got some awa and prepared the awa
to be pounded. After pounding a sufficient quantity, Kaeha went out to cool himself.
Upon seeing Kaeha Kaulu came out of his hiding place and met his brother. At seeing
this small fellow Kaeha asked: “Who is this small boy?” “I am Kaulu, your youngest
brother, whom you placed on the shelf. Because I love you I came to look for you.”
Kaeha then said: “We are going to drink awa with the spirits.” Kaulu said: “Yes, tell
the spirits to drink their awa first and you take yours after them. Before you drink
yours offer a little to me as your god by repeating the following words: “Here is
our awa.” I will then answer back: “Drink it and let me have the portion that is intoxicating.”
At the close of the conference held by the two Kaulu returned to the palm leaf, while
Kaeha returned to the house to join the spirits. Upon entering the house the spirits
said to Kaeha: “Drink your awa first.” Kaeha replied: “No.” The spirits then drank
theirs up. After the spirits had finished, Kaeha said to the spirits: “Now you be
quiet until after I have taken my awa.” Kaeha then took up his cup of awa and offered
up a prayer:

what he wanted so he took Kaeha with him and flew to Manowaikeoo, a land owned by
Kane and Kanaloa, where all the food belonging to the spirits was raised. The place
was guarded by four men, Uweliki, Uweleka, Maalaka and Maalaki. These men watched
in pairs. In the watch of Maalaka and Maalaki Kaulu and Kaeha were seen so they turned

<p class="first">Through the reaching powers of Kaulu they were able once more to land when Kaulu grabbed
Maalaka and Maalaki, saying: “I am going to kill you two.” They answered: “If we die
there will be no guards fit to watch the land.” This, Kaulu acknowledged. Kaulu and
Kaeha then continued on their way until they found Uweleki and Uweleka on the other
side of the land, who asked: “What do you two want?” Kaulu replied: “All the good
things to eat.” The guards thinking that Kaulu could in no way take all the good things
as he was a very small fellow, allowed Kaulu to have all he wanted. At this Kaulu
took all he could find and eat up all the things he could lay his hands on: the food,
the fish, the pork, the chickens, all the things that were growing and all that had
been planted; Kaulu took everything that could be found and then flew up and hid the
rays of the sun causing darkness. At this the guards begged of Kaulu to give them
back some of the food as seed for propagation, so he gave them one taro top, one potato
leaf, one hog, one chicken and so on to the end of the good things, so Kaulu and Kaeha
returned to Kane and Kanaloa.
</p>
<p>After tasting the different things, Kane and Kanaloa were sure the things tasted just
like the good things of of Manowaikeoo. Upon making this discovery Kane and Kanaloa
sent Kolea and his mate to fly and inquire of Makalii<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23844src" href="#xd32e23844">5</a> where these good things had come from. Upon their arrival, Makalii told them that
these good things were from Manowaikeoo which place had been invaded by Kaulu. On
their arrival in the presence of Kane and Kanaloa, they reported what they had heard
from Makalii. Upon hearing the report all the spirits got angry with Kaulu and Kaeha,
so all the spirits began to tempt Kaeha and urged him to go surf-riding. When they
arrived at the place where the surf was breaking, the spirits called for all the sharks
to come together and take Kaeha and carry him to their king, Kukamaulunuiakea. This
was a very large shark, his length and breadth were unknown. When his mouth was opened
the top jaw would reach to heaven while the bottom jaw would be in the bottom of the
sea; its body was entirely covered over with coral. As Kaeha came in the presence
of the shark, he was swallowed whole. Kaulu at this time was not on his guard which
was the reason <span class="pageNum" id="pb528">[<a href="#pb528">528</a>]</span>why his brother was successfully carried away. After a while Kaulu discovered that
his brother was missing, so he inquired of the spirits where his brother had gone
to. Upon being told that they knew nothing about him, Kaulu then felt that he was
dead. He then proceeded to the seashore, stooped down and drank up the sea so that
all the fish were stranded, dry. Kaulu then began to make a search for his brother
in all the different man-eating fish, the common shark, the tiger shark and the hihimanu,
but he was unable to find him. He then searched in all the four corners of the sea
and still Kaeha was not to be found. Kaulu then flew up to Makalii to enquire of him
for the whereabouts of Kaeha. When he came up to Makalii he found him lying down with
his face turned up. Kaulu then pinched his mons veneris at the same time calling him:
“Dead you are, Makalii. What have you to say?” Makalii replied: “Your oldest brother
is in a shark.” Kaulu asked: “Tell me of him.” While Kaulu was asking these questions
of Makalii, Koeleele, a younger brother of Makalii, came in with a large rock, called
Ikuwa, which was larger than the island of Maui. Koeleele was a man who had a very
bad temper and he was a very powerful man. At sight of Kaulu he threw the rock at
him, but Kaulu braced up his fore- or poi finger and held the rock up and then said:
“Say, the rock from the mighty one is held up, <span class="corr" id="xd32e23851" title="Source: is’nt">isn’t</span> it?” When Koeleele heard this he ran away, thus saving himself from Kaulu.
</p>
<p>Kaulu then asked of Makalii: “Tell me the shark that swallowed my brother and also
the place where the shark lives.” Makalii then looked, but he was unable to see anything
below them, so he chewed some kukui nuts and blew the oily substance over the atmosphere
beneath them which caused it to be clear and he was thus enabled to locate the shark
which had swallowed Kaeha. Makalii then pointed him out to Kaulu at the same time
saying: “It is the one overgrown<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23856src" href="#xd32e23856">6</a> with coral.”

said: “Say, if you all wish to take a ride on the swing, I will pull the <span class="pageNum" id="pb530">[<a href="#pb530">530</a>]</span>rope.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23873src" href="#xd32e23873">8</a> He then proceeded to instruct them how to ride the swing. “In my country we ride
the swing by sitting facing one another to the full length or top of the rope; then
the swing is pulled and the pleasure begins.” In this way all those spirits were killed,
by the swing breaking. When the remaining spirits saw this trick played on them by
Kaulu, they thought they would get even with him by again enticing Kaeha to go with
them for rod-fishing. On this fishing excursion Kaeha was killed and he was put in
the shell of a bitter opihi,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23884src" href="#xd32e23884">9</a> the kind that sticks to the smooth boulders. On missing Kaeha, Kaulu went in search
of him until he discovered him in an opihi; but on account of its smooth surface he
was unable to get the opihi from the boulder, so he urinated on the opihi, which released
Kaeha. This action caused all the opihi of this kind to become bitter to this day,
and it has always been known from that day as the bitter opihi.
</p>
<p>After Kaeha was brought to life again by Kaulu they returned to live on Oahu. When
they arrived at Papakolea, Moanalua, Kaulu left Kaeha at this place while he continued
on his way to Kapalama in search of Haumea. Haumea was a spirit that lived at Niuhelewai,
Oahu. It was a female spirit. Upon the arrival of Kaulu he found Haumea asleep. Kaulu
then called: “Say, Haumea, why don’t you get up, cook your food and afterwards fight
with Kaulu?” Haumea then sat up while Kaulu returned home and then flew up to Makalii
who asked him: “What is it you want, Kaulu?” “I have come for the net.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23894src" href="#xd32e23894">10</a> Give it to me so that I will be able to kill Haumea.” Makalii then gave him his nets,
Maoleha and its mate. Kaulu then returned and again found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then
surrounded the house with the nets, after which he called out to Haumea: “Are you
to continue on sleeping? Why don’t you get up and let us fight?” Haumea then woke
up and tried this way and that to get out of the house. Kaulu kept at some distance
away from the house and ran around it. At seeing Kaulu running around, Haumea attempted
to get after him and was entangled in the net where she was caught and killed. Kaulu
then went for Kaeha and they returned to Kailua [Oahu] their birthplace where their
parents were then living.

<p>Makapailu, the mother of Pili who was a great fortune-teller, in a vision saw the
spirit of Hoamakeikekula standing before her; and on being asked: “What does this
beautiful young woman, whom I have not seen before, want?” Hoamakeikekula answered:
“I am your granddaughter who has been thrown away by your daughter Pili. I am the
younger child, next to Waikuaala, therefore I want you to come for me. I am in a pile
of sugar-cane trash in the form of a taro bulb. Make haste or I shall be devoured
by dogs.” When Makapailu heard this call from her grandchild, she rose and started
on her journey, weeping. When Makapailu arrived at the pile of sugar-cane trash, she
looked it over and lo she beheld a small rainbow in a thick fog, which moved toward
her until it stood in her very presence. As she kept gazing thereon, her eyes grew
dim and after a while she closed them. When she looked again she saw a taro bulb;
she took it up and wrapped it in a red kapa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24004src" href="#xd32e24004">4</a> and returned home. Upon arriving at her home, she told her husband, Hawaimake by
name of what she <span class="pageNum" id="pb534">[<a href="#pb534">534</a>]</span>had done. At the end of twenty days the outside covering of the package was removed
and Makapailu looked and saw that the taro had changed and was in the form of a very
beautiful female child, one without a blemish and very pleasant to look upon. The
grandparents from this time on brought her up with great surveillance under very strict

to dwell on the forests. On retiring the next night she again dreamed of the same

<p class="first">Ku was the father and Hina<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24235src" href="#xd32e24235">1</a> was the mother. They had two children, Hookaakaaikapakaakaua<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24238src" href="#xd32e24238">2</a> a son, and Kapuaokaoheloai<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24243src" href="#xd32e24243">3</a> a daughter. Waiakea in Hilo is the country where these people lived. The brother
was the first born and the sister the last. These people were of high chief rank of
Hilo. These two children were brought up without knowing that they were brother and
sister. They never saw each other although they lived in the same house. The brother
had a male attendant and the sister a female attendant. They were brought up under
a very strict kapu; they never went out of doors, not even for the calls of nature.
Ku and Hina also left word with the attendants that if the brother sought the sister,
then he and his attendant would be banished to Kuaihelani (a land in Tahiti), and
so with the other. This manner of living was maintained for twenty years, without
their seeing one another. One day the attendants as was their custom went to the uplands
of Kaumana, directly above Punahoa to do farm work. After the departure of the attendants
in the early morning, Kapuaokaoheloai arose and walked out of doors. Upon looking
back at the house she saw a bright light within; so she again entered the house and
began a search and found a door, which she opened. As she walked in she saw a red
object lying on a bed. She removed the tapa from the face and saw a very handsome
young man. They then slept together until the sun had passed the meridian, when she
returned to her part of the house.

<p>When the attendants returned they did not discover the actions of their two charges.
This conduct was kept up for ten full days. One evening Kapuaokaoheloai caught some
chickens and brought them to her bed where they were concealed. That evening she and
her attendant retired very early. Not very long after they had retired, Kapuaokaoheloai
woke up and shook the chickens which caused the roosters to crow. She then said to
her attendant: “It is daylight. It is now time for you two to go up and tend to our
farm work.” The attendant replied: “How quickly daylight has come. It seems that I
have just closed my eyes when I heard the cock crowing.” She woke up and went out
of doors and looked up at the Milky Way which had not made its appearance: so she
reentered the house and went to bed again. Kapuaokaoheloai after <span class="pageNum" id="pb542">[<a href="#pb542">542</a>]</span>a while again reached for the chickens and shook them and the roosters again crowed.
She woke her attendant and said: “It is daylight, the chickens are all crowing together.”
Her attendant then rose and went over to the other part of the house where the male
attendant was sleeping and woke him up. The two rose and started on their way to the
farm lands. As soon as they left, Kapuaokaoheloai got up and went over to the other
side of the house where her brother was and they slept together. When the two attendants
were half way up to the farm lands, they sat down to await the approach of daylight.
After waiting for some time and daylight not appearing they returned to the house
and discovered their charges sleeping together. The male attendant then said to the
female attendant: “I am going up to inform their parents in obedience to the instructions
given us in the beginning.” The female attendant who was his wife replied: “Yes, you
must go up.” When the male attendant arrived at the home of Ku and Hina, he told them
of the conduct of their two charges. At this Ku gave orders to his men to go and kill
the female attendant. When the men arrived they caught her to carry out the death
order, but she spoke up: “Don’t kill me here, take me to the chief’s presence and
there I will die. I want the chief to hear me first.” When they arrived in the presence
of Ku and Hina, Ku asked the men: “Why did you save her? Why didn’t you kill her?”
“She asked that after you have heard what she has to say then she will die.” Ku then
asked: “What have you to say?” The attendant replied: “The chief said, that if my
charge should make the first approach then I was to be banished with her to Kuaihelani.
This was also your charge and command in reference to the other one of us and his
charge. That is what I wish to say to the chief.” “Yes, you are right, you shall not
die; you and your charge shall go to Kuaihelani.”

<p>When she arrived in the presence of her charge, the double canoe was made ready and
they sailed off; herself and her charge and two canoe paddlers making four of them.
They sailed from Hawaii to Maui; from Maui to Oahu; from Oahu to Kauai and landed
at Waimea. As they went ashore they saw a canoe on the beach from the king of Kuaihelani
who was in search of a wife. When the two messengers saw Kapuaokaoheloai and her beauty,
they said: “We are going to make an inspection of the whole group and if we fail to
find a woman who will surpass your beauty, then we will take you as the wife for our
king.” Kapuaokaoheloai and her companions, therefore, <span class="corr" id="xd32e24257" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> at Waimea for over ten days, till the return of the messengers who reported that
they had failed to find one equally as beautiful as Kapuaokaoheloai; so they embarked
on their canoe and set sail for Kuaihelani. After they had been on their way for over
forty days, the messengers of Kuaihelani said: “We will soon see land; we have yet,
however, to smell the sweet perfume of the kiele.” After some days they caught the
perfume of the kiele and soon after saw a beautiful country. The men then said to
Kapuaokaoheloai: “When we reach land and arrive at the king’s house, and he should
invite you to come up to him on the kapa cloth,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24260src" href="#xd32e24260">4</a> don’t accept the invitation for it will mean death to you. If his daughter should
invite you on the steps with her don’t go or it will be your death; only when they
take you by the hand must you accept.” They then landed and proceeded to the place
of the king. Upon seeing her the king greeted her, which greeting she returned. The
king then invited her to come to him on to the kapa, this she refused.

<p>When the father heard the report from the birds he ordered all the priests who were
versed in the telling of coming events and hidden things, to come and inspect the
stranger to see whether she was of high rank or not. “If she is of very high rank
she shall not die. If she is not of high rank then she must die.” The priests then
gathered and inspected her and at the end they all agreed that her parents were not
of high rank. They were of one mind with the king that she must indeed die, because
she had climbed the sacred platform. There was, however, one amongst the priesthood
who was not present at this time; so he was sent for by the king, to come and tell
his knowledge concerning the stranger. When he arrived in the presence of the king,
the king asked him: “Can you give a true interpretation concerning the rank of this
woman? Whether she is of high rank or not?” The priest replied: “Yes.” The priest
then continued: “She is of the highest rank and is a chiefess from the east; she is
even more sacred than your daughter. The sacred platform is not for such as your daughter;
it is the resting place of this one. She is far above your daughter in rank. She is
none other, but is of your own blood; her mother, Hina, was the first-born and you
came after. She <span class="pageNum" id="pb546">[<a href="#pb546">546</a>]</span>originally belonged to Kuaihelani but moved to Hawaii where she now lives.” This saved

<p>It was customary for Kapuaokaoheloai to weep for her brother; so one day Kapuaokaohelo
asked her: “Why are you weeping?” “I am weeping for my brother.” “Where is he?” “He
is in Hawaii.” “Is he handsome?” “Yes, I am but as the skin of his feet.” “Oh dear,
how can I see him?” Her friend replied: “If you wish to see him, you shall.” That
night in their sleep she sought after and brought the spirit of her brother and made
it sleep with her friend. This was kept up for several nights in succession until
ten full nights had passed when her friend became so much in love that she made up
her mind to go in search of her lover. So one day she said to her friend: “Where abouts
is your home?” “It is where the sun rises. If you should go, the first land you come
to is Kauai, then Oahu, then Molokai, then Maui and then Hawaii. It is, however, at
the first point where the sun comes up, called Kumukahi. The harbor Punahoa and Waianuenue
is the first object to be seen upon landing. The large house which you will see in
the upland is our home; my brother is still there with his attendant.” Soon after
these instructions were given, her friend left Kuaihelani and set sail in her canoes
until she arrived at Hilo and landed at Punahoa, where she saw a house standing in
the uplands. When she arrived at the house she saw an old man sitting just within
the door and a sick boy lying down. At seeing this she was puzzled, so inquired: “Is
there no one else beside you two in this house?” “No, only us two.” She then returned

to go traveling from place to place. One day while on one of his travels he saw Kaunoa
bathing. At sight of her he halted on his way and looked at this beautiful woman.
He was so overcome with her beauty that he approached her and asked her to be his
wife while he remained in that neighborhood. To this Kaunoa assented. After they had
lived together for a while, Ku believing that it was impossible for him to prolong
his stay, told Kaunoa: “I am certain that you are with child. If you give birth to

<p>Kaunoa in due course of time gave birth to a male child to which she gave the name
of Kalanimanuia. She and her husband both brought up the boy until he was big and
strong. Kalanimanuia was very handsome and pleasant to look upon. After he had grown
into boyhood it was his custom to invite other boys to the house and give them all
the food; when the father returned home and found the food all gone he would get angry
and give Kalanimanuia a scolding. As Kalanimanuia continued to do this the father
kept on scolding him and at times would whip the boy. One day while he was whipping
the boy the mother, Kaunoa, upon hearing the boy crying, said: “Why do you whip the
boy so constantly? He is not your son, he is somebody else’s son.” Upon hearing this
Kalanimanuia asked his mother: “Who is my father then?” The mother denied this and
said: “You have no other father, this is your own father.” The boy, however, was not
satisfied with his mother’s answer and kept on asking her. This was kept up for over
ten days, when Kaunoa finally said: “Yes, here are your father’s tokens, go in search
of him.” She then gave him the loin cloth and the spear. Kalanimanuia then set out
in search of Ku. Upon his arrival in the presence of Ku, Ku ordered his servants to
seize the boy, take him to the sea and kill him; for Ku did not recognize the lad.
Kalanimanuia was therefore killed and his body thrown into the sea. The exact place
where Kalanimanuia was thrown was at the Kualoa point, in Koolau, Oahu. He was killed
at this place.

<p>In this temple were two old men who acted as the guards of the place, being placed
there by Ku the king. When they saw the spirit come into the temple every evening,
with the voice of the child calling, they said to one another: “That must be the boy
the king threw into the sea.” The old men after a time became deeply attached to the
spirit of the boy; so they kept it and being priests they worshipped it. This was
maintained for some days until the spirit assumed a real human form and was able to
ask for its clothing and for food; so they gave him all the things they had in their

<p>Shortly after this they went to Ku and told him what the boy had told them. Ku then
began to think and after a while told the old men: “Yes, it is true that I had a son.”
The old men then asked Ku: “Did you not take one to wife and when you parted from
her, left with her certain things?” “Yes, I did take one Kaunoa to wife and I left
with her certain things; a loin cloth and a spear.” “Then the boy you killed must
have been your own son.” “Yes,” said Ku, “it must have been my own son.” Ku then inquired
of the old men: “How am I to get my son?” The old men said: “Get a net, surround the
house with three thicknesses and on the outside of that place a very fine net.” Late
that evening the spirit of the boy returned to the temple as usual and fell asleep.
While the spirit of the boy was sleeping the house was surrounded by three thicknesses
of net. On the approach of day the spirit woke up and started to return to the sea.
As it came out it saw that the house was surrounded by nets. The spirit then began
to tear the nets. Daylight, however, found him entangled within the fine net. When
the spirit was finally caught it had the form of a rat. It was then worked over until
it almost assumed its human form again. A few days after this the daughter of Ku,

very ugly indeed.” “Aholenuimakaukai is another sweetheart of mine.” “Yes, he will

<p class="first">In all these conversations, Kawaunuiaola showed great cunning. When those who heard
her went on their way, they told others that Kawaunuiaola must have obtained a new
husband. This was carried to Hoeu her husband one day in the following way: “Say,
Hoeu, your wife, Kawaunuiaola acts in a very strange way; she must have obtained a
new husband, for we have heard two voices talking; one in the voice of a female and
the other in the voice of a man. It must be a new husband.” When Hoeu heard this from
the people, he stood up and deserted the woman he was living with, the woman who enticed
him away from Kawaunuiaola and he returned to his wife, at Kula. Upon his arrival
at their home he asked his wife as to the rumors he had heard, which the wife denied,
saying: “I have no husband, I am all alone.” They again made up and lived on as husband
and wife. She was indeed cunning.

aku fishing. Aiai upon hearing his wife’s request asked her to go to her father, Kipapalaulu

Upon coming in her father’s presence, he asked her: “What is it you want?” “I have

took it and returned to her husband. When Aiai saw the fish-hook, he said: “This pearl
fish-hook is worthless, the fish will not bite it; it will weary one’s body for nothing.”
The wife then asked him: “Where can I get another pearl fish-hook then?” Aiai replied:
“You go to your father and tell him there is a pearl fish-hook that will enrich the
fishermen. It is in the fishermen’s calabash of fishing utensils.” By this the husband
wished to get possession of the pearl fish-hook Kahuoi which had been stolen from

<p>Upon coming to her father she asked for another pearl fish-hook. Kipapalaulu refused,
saying: “There is none left to give; that was the last pearl fish-hook I had which
I gave you.” Kauaelemimo said: “Aiai told me, you had another one; it is in the fishermen’s
calabash of fishing utensils.” “Yes, certainly there is one. I now remember it for
the first time.” The calabash was then brought to the king and when he looked in it
he found the hook which he gave to his daughter. The wife then returned with it to
her husband. Aiai took it and said: “My days of poverty<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24630src" href="#xd32e24630">8</a> are now <span class="pageNum" id="pb558">[<a href="#pb558">558</a>]</span>over since you have come back.” Aiai then said to his wife: “Go back again to your

one that is ten fathoms in length; that is the size of the canoe that I want from
your father.” When Kauaelemimo arrived in the presence of her father, she asked for
the canoe described by her husband. When the canoe ten fathoms in length was brought
the father asked the daughter: “Who will be able to paddle this canoe?” “My husband
will.” When Aiai heard the answer made by his wife, he took the canoe and set out
with the bird, Kamanuwai, taking the pearl fish-hook, Kahuoi, along. When he arrived
off of Mamala he took out the hook and began fishing. The aku began to come and jump
into the canoe of their own accord until it was loaded down deep. The bird then eat
some of the fish and was again restored to its former self. When Aiai came home his
double canoe was loaded down deep with aku. Upon arriving in the presence of his wife
he gave her all the fish, but the pearl fish-hook was taken by the bird, Kamanuwai,
its guardian. This is the legend of Aiai.

take it, cut it up and prepare some and drink it. The master after this had all the
awa he wanted and the dog kept him supplied for many days. The dog, however, went
to the place so often that after a while very little of the field was left; so Hakau
began to be suspicious and therefore set guards over the field. While the guards were
watching one night, the dog came to the field and began pulling up the awa; when he
had a sufficient amount for a load it took up the load and returned home. The guards
then were sure that a dog was pulling the king’s awa, so they followed it. The dog
being much faster than the guards it got away; but one fellow who was a good runner
kept up the chase until Pupualenalena was finally tracked to Puako. When the guard
saw the dog’s master he was covered with scales from the constant use of awa. The
guard then approached him and asked: “Say, is this your dog?” The master replied:
“Yes.” The guard then said: “You two have sinned <span class="pageNum" id="pb560">[<a href="#pb560">560</a>]</span>against the king, Hakau. Your dog has been stealing the awa which belongs to the king.”
The guard then took the man and his dog and brought them to Hakau in the valley of
Waipio. When they arrived in the presence of Hakau, Hakau asked: “Is this your dog?”
“Yes, it is mine,” answered the man. Hakau asked: “Have you been <span class="corr" id="xd32e24664" title="Source: drinkking">drinking</span> my awa then?” “Yes, I have been drinking it. I thought that the awa came from some
place nearer home. But I am mistaken, and that he has been getting it from Waipio,
here.” Hakau replied: “Yes, I am going to kill both of you for taking my awa.”

<p>During this time, in the reign of Hakau, there was a large shell used as a trumpet,
called Kuana, that was owned by the spirits which lived above Waipio. This shell was
blown every night and the sound from it made Hakau angry. So he said to the master
of Pupualenalena: “I will, however, save you and your dog if you will get me the shell
owned by the spirits.” While Hakau was speaking, Pupualenalena heard and understood
the king’s wish. That night the shell was again blown by the spirits. At midnight
the king of the spirits retired leaving the guards to keep watch; but later on they
also fell asleep. Pupualenalena then stole in and jumped over the sleeping guards.
Seeing the shell hanging over the king, it jumped over him, took the shell, stuck
his head in through the loop of the string by which it was hung up and ran off with
it. While in its flight and just as he was out of the house one side of the shell
struck a rock and a piece of the shell was broken off. Upon hearing the crack of the
shell the spirits woke up and gave chase, but they were unable to catch the dog.
</p>
<p>When the dog arrived in the presence of Hakau with the shell, he was so happy that
he thereupon placed the master and his dog on a piece of land near by, and they became
great favorites with Hakau.

<p>Puako was a very handsome man whose form was perfect. When he saw Mailelaulii he took
her to be his wife and that night they were covered with the same kapa. Very early
the next morning the girls looked and saw Puako carrying sea water and filling pools
for salt making. Upon seeing this the sisters got disgusted and said to Mailelaulii:
“Say, if that is going to be your husband we will all be made weary carrying <span class="pageNum" id="pb562">[<a href="#pb562">562</a>]</span>sea water for salt making and our skins will look like the windward bark of a noni

Kohala. When they arrived at Kokoiki, in Kohala, they met Hikapoloa, the chief of

<p>Shortly after this some of the Kohala people sailed for Kekaha and from there continued

Mumu and his brothers were fishermen and caught aku and all other kinds of fish. They
had in their possession some very rare pearl fish-hooks, which supplied them with

<p>After Hikapoloa had been home for some time he gave orders that the canoes be made
ready to go out fishing for aku. When the canoes were ready they started out and upon
coming to the aku grounds he took up the fish-hook and held it in his hand, thinking
that the aku would jump into the canoe of their own accord. He held the hook this
way all day until the paddlers were stiff with cold, but no aku was caught. Upon failing
to get any aku he took it as sufficient cause for the death of his brothers-in-law.
When they arrived home, Hikapoloa did not tell his wife of his plans to kill his brothers-in-law;

canoe was loaded down deep with aku. As they came ashore they were all faint with
hunger from want of food; so they went to the house of the watchman expecting to obtain

then said to Mumu: “You go on up and when you get there bring us some food. After

When Mumu arrived outside of the enclosure surrounding the house, he asked of the
watchman: “Where are the chiefesses?” The watchman said: “That is afterwards; enter
the house and have some food first, then you may see your relations.” On thus being

<p class="first">It was amongst the steep cliffs to the east of Kohala, Hawaii, that Pupuhuluena once
lived. When he first came to the place there was no food growing, no taro, no potatoes,
no yams, nor anything else in the shape of food. All the food had been taken and hidden
by the gods in Kalae, Kau. Once upon a time Pupuhuluena had a desire to go fishing,
so he sailed to a point directly off Makaukiu. While he was busy fishing, he saw that
all the different fishes were gathered under his canoe; the uhu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24964src" href="#xd32e24964">1</a> the nenue,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24972src" href="#xd32e24972">2</a> ulua,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24980src" href="#xd32e24980">3</a> kahala,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24988src" href="#xd32e24988">4</a> opakapaka,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e24996src" href="#xd32e24996">5</a> hee,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25005src" href="#xd32e25005">6</a> manini,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25012src" href="#xd32e25012">7</a> opelu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25020src" href="#xd32e25020">8</a> aku<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25028src" href="#xd32e25028">9</a> and all the other kinds of fishes. When he saw the fish move away he followed them
until the cliffs were passed, and as the fish kept on going he followed right along;
he arrived off Kohala, still the fish kept on: he arrived off Kawaihae, still the
fish kept on: then on to Puako and to Maniniowali where the manini remained behind,
but he still followed until he was off Kekaha and from there on to Kaelehuluhulu;
here the aku and opakapaka remained behind. Proceeding again until he was off the
Kona coast, here some of the other fishes remained behind, but he kept on following
the others until he was off the place called Kapukaulua, just this side of Kalae where
the ulua remained behind. At this place he saw a canoe floating with a large-mouth
net let down on the coral bed. There were two fishermen in the canoe, Ieiea and Poopalu;
they were the fishermen of Makalii.

<p>Pupuhuluena upon seeing the men moved on until he was quite close to them. He then
took up a kukui nut, chewed it up and blew the substance upon the surface of the sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25038src" href="#xd32e25038">10</a> which enabled him to clearly see the bottom. As he looked down he saw the fish entering
the mouth of the net, let down by Ieiea and Poopalu, so he called out: “Say, the fish
have gone into your net.” “You are telling a lie. We are looking down and we don’t
see any fish going in.” The reason why Ieiea and Poopalu did not see the fish was
because they were chewing the sea-bean (mohihi) and blowing the juice on the surface
of the sea which did not render the sea smooth, so they were unable to see the bottom
very clearly. The place where they had their net was not very deep. Pupuhuluena, however,
kept on calling to haul up the net till at last Ieiea and Poopalu thought they would
haul up the net, when to their surprise they discovered it was full of fish. When
Ieiea and Poopalu saw that Pupuhuluena had something they did not have they requested
some kukui nut; so Pupuhuluena gave some of his nuts to the fishermen and they threw
away their sea-beans. These two fishermen kept some of the nuts and when they arrived
home they planted some. This is how the kukui<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25041src" href="#xd32e25041">11</a> was first introduced into the districts of Kona and Kau.

“Let the canoe come ashore at the safe landing place.” This place where the gods were
directing them to land was the refuse heap, which place by their power was made to
be calm, while the usual landing place was made to be very rough. Poopalu, however,
instructed Pupuhuluena from within the basket to say: “That is a refuse heap; here

When the gods heard Pupuhuluena, they remarked amongst themselves: “He is a native
son of the soil and not a stranger.” The regular landing place then became calm while
the rough sea went back to the place opposite the refuse heap. As Pupuhuluena went
ashore, the gods came down to help him lift the canoe. At this Pupuhuluena said: “The
stern of my canoe is kapued. I will lift that part myself while you can lift the forward
part.” After the canoe was carried ashore, the gods brought all the different kinds

of death and of life; of good and of evil. She taught him all that she knew, whereupon

sea coast where a canoe was lying. He took the canoe and started on his journey, first
landing at Keoneoio at Honuaula where he spent the night. Early the next morning he
again boarded his canoe and set sail landing at Kaunolu, Lanai. From this place he
again set sail and landed at Kalaau Point, near Kaunakakai, Molokai, where he <span class="corr" id="xd32e25171" title="Source: staid">stayed</span> over night. On the next day he left Molokai and set sail for Oahu, landing at Hanauma
where he left his canoe and proceeded overland; he first stopped at Kaimuki, then
at Niuhelewai, where he took a bath, then continued on his way till he came to Pokai,
in Waianae, where he spent the night. When he woke up the next morning he saw the
canoes of Pueonuiokona, from Kauai, preparing for their return, so he proceeded to
the landing place and asked of the men that he be allowed to accompany them to Kauai.
At this request the men said: “Be off, you shameless <span class="corr" id="xd32e25174" title="Source: youngter">youngster</span>, you shall not take passage in the king’s canoes.”

<p>That night the boy retired very early and at the crowing of the first cock he got
up. Taking his calabash he proceeded to the landing and took one of the canoes that
were lying there and set out for Kauai. The king, accompanied by his men, got to the

ordered to sail. When Kauai was seen, those with the king saw something floating ahead
of them, and when they drew nearer to the object they saw it was a canoe with the
boy in it. The king then called out to the boy: “I see that you came ahead of us and
we wasted our time waiting for you.” “Yes, I thought that the king’s canoes were already
overloaded with bulky things and with big men and large packages, so I made up my
mind to come ahead in the dark with the idea, however, of being overtaken by you here

<p>When they arrived at this place they met two of the king’s canoes which had been out
fishing that night, loaded deep down with fish. At seeing this the boy asked the king:
“Oh king, let me have some fish.” The king answered: “Take one of the canoes of fish
for you.” The boy, however, reached down and only took up two fish, one was an oililepa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25194src" href="#xd32e25194">6</a> and the other a kikakapu.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25202src" href="#xd32e25202">7</a> The king then asked the boy: “Are those the only fish you are going to take?” “These
are all the fish I am going to take as they are the kind that will cook quickly.”
</p>
<p>Soon after this the boy left Hanalei and proceeded on his way, going by way of Koolau
until he arrived at Waiakalua where he rested. From this place he continued on to
Anahola; thence on to Kealia and then on to Wailua where Kalanialiiloa resided, where
was his bone fence, almost completed, built from human bones. When he arrived at the
place he looked and saw the bones of Halepaki his father; they were still fresh, the
bones not yet being bleached. At sight of this the boy bowed in sorrow and wept. After
his weeping he approached the flagstaff and pushed it down and put up the oililepa,
one of the fish brought along by him. He then next took the kapu stick and pushed
it down and put up in its place the other fish, the kikakapu. By this action of the
boy, it was meant as a challenge to the people that he was come to meet them in a
wrangling contest. When Kalanialiiloa and his instructors saw the action of the boy,
they knew at once that he was challenging them to a contest of wits, so a messenger

<p>When the boy arrived outside of the house, the chief’s instructors in the profession
of wrangling called out: “You have to remain outside, for there you will sleep then
get up and eat, where the wind and rain will beat down on you. You shall remain there
and die there. For die you must, young man, for you cannot come in here.”
</p>
<p>The boy saw at once that no time would be wasted by the Kauai people nor would they
allow him time to prepare himself although he knew that that was a part of the profession;
but they did not, however, find him unprepared, the boy immediately replied: “You
must then remain in there, you full-grown men until you die. Eat up what food you
have, obey the calls of nature, and eat, you must die within for you cannot come out.”
</p>
<p>At this Kalanialiiloa spoke up: “The boy is indeed right. He is on the outside where
he can sleep and get up and can go where he pleases; whereas we are huddled up in
here, and after we have eaten up our food and fish and have drunk up our water we
will not be able to get any more as we cannot go out. We will, therefore, remain in
here until we die. It is, therefore, best that we befriend the boy and allow him to
enter.” The instructors, however, refused to allow this. In this both sides came out
even. The men had intended to best the boy in their battle of witty remarks when the
boy would have been killed.

<p>The men then proceeded to take up all the mats and grass spread on the floor to serve
as a covering and left the bare dirt. They then poured water on the dirt and made
mud, making it unfit for any person to sit down on. They then called for the boy,
saying: “You will surely die now for we have taken up all the covering from the floor
leaving it bare.” The boy then entered the house and looked down at the lowest battens,
which were next to the ground and then addressed his calabash: “Say, you must sit
down here on this part of the floor where it has a covering.” At this the men said:
“You are a deceiving young man, there is no covering left on the floor, for we have
taken it all up.” The boy replied: “When the framework of this house was put up the
battens were put on, beginning with the lowest one called the bottom covering. If
so, then why can not I call it a covering.” “And why not? It is a covering because
it is laid at the bottom, and furthermore the rest of the battens are fastened above
that one,” said the chief. The men said: “The boy may have beaten us in that, but
he will never find this our next move.” The men then spread out makaloa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25227src" href="#xd32e25227">8</a> grass on the floor, then their Niihau<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e25238src" href="#xd32e25238">9</a> mats over the grass, then took out their kapas made on Kauai and laid them down,

the string, a squeaking noise was heard, to which the boy said: “What a squeaking
pig this is.” He then placed it on the umu and peeled off the bark leaving the white
wood exposed; the next thing was to cut it open which he did and took out a piece
of pork and portions of the offal of a pig, which had already been wrapped up in this
piece of wood, and he then went through the act of cooking it in the umu. After the
supposed pig was put in the umu, he reached for a few pieces of umu covering from

<p class="first">Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani
was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom
he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26314src" href="#xd32e26314">1</a> was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to
wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after
this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home.
If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl
call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire
to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the
child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26319src" href="#xd32e26319">2</a> She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a

to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which
to recognize his daughter<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26325src" href="#xd32e26325">4</a> and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other
things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made
as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same
shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.

<p>After the birth of Laukiamanuikahiki, Hina and her husband brought her up all by themselves.
It was Laukiamanuikahiki’s custom to bring in other children to their home and give
them all the food; which action caused her father to get angry and very often punished
her. This punishment was kept up by the father for some time.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26330src" href="#xd32e26330">5</a> Because of this, the child suspected that this man could not be her own father; so
she began questioning her mother who her own father was until the mother could bear
it no longer. Hina then said to Laukiamanuikahiki: “You go to that cliff; that is
your father.” Upon coming to the cliff, she asked: “Are you my father?” The cliff
denied this saying: “I am not your father.” The child returned to Hina and begged:
“Tell me of my father.” “Yes, you go to that bambu bush, that is your father.” When
she arrived at the place, she asked the bambu bush: “Are you my father?” “I am not
your father, Makiioeoe is your father, he has gone back to Kuaihelani.” When Laukiamanuikahiki
again arrived in the presence of her mother she said: “You have deceived me. Makiioeoe
I understand is my father and he has gone back to Kuaihelani. You have hidden this
from me.” “Yes, he is your father, and he has left word that you must not come to
him without a sign or you will have a terrible suffering. You have to go to him in
a red canoe having red sails, red cords, red men and must be accompanied by a large
canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men.” Laukiamanuikahiki <span class="pageNum" id="pb598">[<a href="#pb598">598</a>]</span>replied: “I am not going to remain, I am going in search of my father.” “Yes, you
may go, but you will have to suffer untold agony. Go until you come to two old women
roasting bananas by the wayside. They are your grandmothers, for they are my own mother
and aunt. Reach down and take away the bananas and let them search for them until
they ask whose offspring you are, then tell them, ‘Your own.’ ‘Ours from whom?’ ‘From
Hina.’ Then when they ask you, ‘What brings you our lord<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26335src" href="#xd32e26335">6</a> here to us?’ Tell them, ‘I want a roadway.’ ”

<p>When she arrived in the presence of the old women she followed according to the instruction
of Hina. At the conclusion the old women said: “There is a roadway; here it is, a
bambu stalk. You climb to the top of it and when it leans over it will reach Kuaihelani.”
Laukiamanuikahiki then climbed to the top of the bambu stalk and sat there. The bambu
then began to shoot up and when it had reached a great distance it leaned over until
the end reached Kuaihelani. Laukiamanuikahiki stepped off the bambu and proceeded
along the road until she met a girl whom she took as a friend. They then went along
until they came to a flower garden. The flowers of this garden were all kapu; none
were to string them into wreaths until they shall have been picked by the daughter
of Makiioeoe; the flowers of the ilima,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e26342src" href="#xd32e26342">7</a> the marigold and other flowers and also the maile vine. There were guards in the
garden who were watching the flowers. Laukiamanuikahiki, however, reached out and
picked the flowers, took the maile vines and broke them off. When they came to the
pool of water, which had been kapued until it was first used by the daughter of Makiioeoe,
Laukiamanuikahiki uncovered herself and plunged into the pool of water, when a turtle
came up to her and began rubbing her back<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> After she finished bathing she went up on the bank. When the guards saw what she
had done, they said: “You are indeed a strange girl bathing in the pool of water which
is kapued and reserved only for the king’s daughter. You will indeed die.”
</p>
<p>When the guards arrived in the presence of Makiioeoe, they told him of all the girl’s
doings. Makiioeoe then ordered that wood be prepared for the girl and to pack it to
the seashore where the umu was to be started the next day, for on that day the girl
was to be killed. The guards then returned, took the girl by the hands, bound them
at her back and led her to the pig house where she was tied, the guards standing watch
over her that night.
</p>
<p>That night her friend came and asked that she too be bound; but Laukiamanuikahiki
said: “No, you must be at liberty so as to bring me food, meat and clothing.” Her
friend consented to this.

the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she
was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe,
a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should
accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without
any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and

girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and
roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is

looked and saw a bright light on the outside of the house; so he said to Makiioeoe:
“Say, your house is on fire!” Makiioeoe replied: “That is not a fire, it is some person
sleeping within, it is your sister.” They then entered the house and Makiioeoe approached
the bed and roused his daughter saying: “Wake up, here is your brother Kahikiula.”
Laukiamanuikahiki awoke from her sleep and turned down on her breast. She then looked

“Say, Lipewale, what has become of your kukui nuts?” She answered: “You fixed the
bundle and I put it on my back and followed behind you. I have no eyes at my back
